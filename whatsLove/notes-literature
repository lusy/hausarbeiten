# Laurie Penny - Chapter Love and Lies

"And yet somehow, so little has changed.
Because despite their money, their privilege, their friendships, the great sex they seemed to be having, the jobs they apparently had, although they rarely seemed to actually do them, the weird spoilt child-women of Sex and the City were still miserable, still looking for something — if they hadn't been, there would have been no story.
What they were looking for was what every woman and girl is still, always, supposed to be looking for: love.
For monogamous, marriage-minded romantic partnership with the man of their dreams.
Every girl's story was a love story."
(-vgl Little Women: "And if the main character is a girl, make sure she is married by the end")

"It demonstrated that even the most powerful, liberated women the world had ever known could still bebrought low by love, could still be ruined by disappointment in the quest for love."

"The colonisation of love by capitalist patriarchy is a deeply painful thing.
It means that structural sexism and cultural violence are played out on small, private stages, which is what makes them so very hard to recognise and resist.
    Human love is radical, and it is devastating.
And human love has been thoroughly captured by neoliberalism, by the mindset and mechanisms of profit."

"Love is a gendered thing.
It also makes life worth living and politics worth doing.
Everyone seems to agree that love is important — but what sort of love?"
"Part of the problem is our lack of language to describe love, and that problem is political.
Semantic context collapse means that we only have one word, 'love', for the vast spectrum of passion and compassion, compresion and care that make our species worth saving.
The English language has hundreds of thousands of words,[..], but only one to describe the very thing we're told is most important."
-> Idea: Struggling with this; Spoken-word performance of bell hooks (and her definition of love)

------------------------


"And of every possible definition of love, it is romantic love between couples, monogamous sexual and social commitment between two people that is considered the most important."
-> Vgl Outlander: Claire gets back in time to be with Jamie
(and at some point has a melt-down realising that she left her whole life, friends and work she loves behind. Which then miraculously disappears, never to be questioned again.)
"This is no accident.
    Love and fucking are the field onwhich gender gets personal.
Where stereotypes are cast in craving and formed in bitterness on every side."

"The more I talk to people about love and work and gender and sex and power, the more it comes down to[..] the stories we tell ourselves and how they map on to our experience of real human beings trying to fit our messy, meaty hearts into the anatomically inaccurate totem of romance."
-> Vgl: Stories spoilt me for romantic love (and also for any love bc I am aspiring to the unreachable ideal of the romantic love) because they created unrealistic expectations of it is supposed to look like.
And the thing about stories is, they are not real.
"the thing about stories is that somebody made them up"

-> Also, I don't have time for a relationship
"I was no longer That Girl.
I didn't have time to save boys any more.
I had other priorites, and those priorities included writing.
You cannot be a writer and have writing be anything other than the central romance of your life"

"And yet love, romantic love, is the one thing we're not supposed to queston.
Why not?"

"When we talk about love conquering all, when we speak, in that glazed, cultish way, of love's healing power.. we are not talking about love in its broadest sense.
We are not referring to the actual practice of caring for a person and being cherished in return, or of giving of oneself for another, whether that be a friend, a family member, a lover or a stranger."
"The notion of romance that we are all encouraged to go searching for is something different.
It is something smaller and more specific.
It is love as ritual and as product, [..] love whose highest ideal is still hererosexual, monogamous romance leading eventually to lasting marriage."
-> "as ritual": vgl Teenies/Pretenies and Crushes: it is a ritual; something to participate in ("ich hab fast das gefühl, ein teil davon war, nur um da mitzumachen und sich mit iwas zu beschäftigen")
This sort of love is valued above every other, even though it is now a minority practice, and even though the many millions who are living happily in such partnerships find the reality far more complex than is considered proper to discuss."
-> no one acknowledges it is actually hard work to maintain a working relationship; a lot of communication, time, energy;

"Both stories, LoveTM and SexTm, hold us up to impossible standards.
Both demand that we see another person as less than human, merely a body filling a prewritten role in our script or romantic or erotic extasy.
Both are wildly unrealistic, and both set us up to fail."
-> Beweis for love is work; for stories spoilt me for relationships; also vgl limerence

"Back in the real world, most people's lives exist on a spectrum somewhere between One True Love and meaningless rutting.
Even those of us taken in by the antasy know this to be the case, and yet it's frowned upon to speak of that spectrum in positive terms.
We are required instead to acknowledge that any person or pair of persons failing to achieve LoveTM or SexTm are doomed to live terribly sad lives"

"LoveTM has become devotional, especially for women.
We search for it, profess belief in it, make sacrifices for it."

"The quest for Great Love is the ultimate devotion, the ultimate sign of being a good woman who can command the interest of men."
"LoveTM demands demonstrations of faith in the face of logic.
'The perfect person is out there,' we say to our friends who are single and sad, as if merely repeating the mantra might make it so."

"Religion, like opium, was a refuge from the anxieties of the age, replacing personal, individual dispair with a whole new set of problems.
Right now, romantic love as we know it functions in much the same way."
"We don't just fall for all of this romantic faff because we're stupid, or guillable, or weak.
We fall because we want to, because we need to believe that something will make the rest of our lives safe and meaningful.
The postures of romance, particularly straight, married romance, allow us to reject the grim meat-hook reality of work and death even as they fashion us for it, pairing us off into little pockets of pain and passion: you and me against the world, baby."
->vlt include cupcake poem??
"To Laurie Penny
Romantic love, we're told, is something rare and precious,
shared love is like the sweet sweet icing of a double-chocolate cupcake:
two hearts and two souls melt into one sticky sugary substance in a paper muffin form.
Each one in its own separate private nest on the muffin pan conform
with what they told us love was like: "The two of us against the world",
                                                and if by some mistake
the dough spills over and more cupcakes on the pan connect
the baker throws them in the trash without a second thought or due respect."

"You can use it [human passion] to isolate people in antagonistic pairs and let them blame each other for the structural lack of sweetness in the world."

"Women across the classes are taught to seek the love of men irst, to assess our worth on the basis of how good we are at keeping and holding male attention.
And across the classes, romantic humiliation can be used to bring women low."
(vgl vlt Ch's "Früher dacht ich, es wäre ein Kompliment, wenn mir jemand nen Klaps auf den Hintern verpasst.")

"But men, too, have equal power of refusal in relationships.
They can refuse to give of themselves in a way that is equally humiliating to women who have grown up learning that they were failing on a basic level if they could not command the ove and commitment of men.
And that's it. That's how heterosexuality makes us all miserable."

The story about "but I only kiss very beautiful girls"
"He's drunk. He doesn't mean to be that much of a prick.
But we both know what he means, and it hurts because he's right: I'm not the sort of girl who gets kissed by boys like that.
I'm not a sexy little package. I'm scrappy and opinionated....."
"And for a moment that sins out reeling in the hurt, private parts of the heart, I wish I was a different kind of girl.
A girl like the girl I see the same boy rolling under a blanket with in the communal bedding area two hours later, soft-spoken with long, pretty hair.
I am eaten up by jealousy, and that's how they get you.
It's the night before a big march, but I abandon sleep.
Instead, I get the laptop out and take it to a place where people are too stoned and sleepy to take notice of my pathetic little tears.
This is stupid. There's work to be done.
Tomorrow tens of thousands of us are going to take to the streets to demand fair access to education, and my smashed little heart shouldn't matter. But it odes.
The whole world is changing, and I just want to be the kind of girl who gets taken in somebody's arms.
[...]
I think about maybe growing my hair out and wearing more skirts.
And that's how they get you.
That's how they keep you in line."

"But deep down, I know if I choose not to play th egood girl game, I might not get as many kisses as I want.
And that's so much more terrifying."
"This, then, is how women are kept in line.
The threat of violence is a fearful thing, but its injustice is clear, and there is always the risk of rebellion. [..]
To tell a person that if they don't do what they're told they will never be loved is an existential threat akin to soul murder.
'If you do not do this, you will be beaten' is ultimately far less effective than 'if you do not do this, nobody will love you.'
It is that fear that keeps us cowed and conformist."
"We don't pare ourselves down and tart ourselves up and process our personality into the mould deemed most pleasing by mainstream culture because we're stupid, or cowardly.
We do it because we fear loss of love.
We do it because we grew up learning, unless our parents were particularly enlightened, that we were unworthy of love unless we conformed to a certain set of rules about how to look, dress and behave."
"If you do follow all the rules, if you ever get it perfectly right, then, of course, you're a dull bimbo, a brainless fembot, just as unworthy of male respect as the ones who didn't."

(comment on Kate Middleton cult)
"As social mobility collapes, princess propaganda is enjoying a shocking pink renaissance, hooking grown women who should know better into the hoary old narrative of One True Love leading inexorably to titular rights to the Duchy of Lancaster.
When we grow up, the princess becomes the shining girl, the good girlfriend.
It may look less likely we'll inherit Cornwall, but we can still be somebody else's beautiful sidekick, which is the best thing a girl can be.
We talk a lot about women as sex objects, but the reduction of women to love objects does just as much damage;[..]
The love object is a thing to be desired and pitied all at once.
She is the helpmeet, the saint, the fantasy.
She is never a complete person.
Whatever attributes make her interesting — maybe she can cook, or sew, or shoot a gun, or solve a crime — she exists ultimately for the hero's edification.
She is nothing without him."
-> Vgl Jo March "I'm sick of .. love is the only thing a woman is fit for."; and manic pixie dream girl; limerence

"Just as many of us, however, spend our lives trying to mould ourselves into love objects.
Almost every female protagonist, in every story written or designed by men, is a love object: a creature fabricated to fulfil a role in somebody else's grand narrative."
-> Vgl Daisy Jones: "I'm not a muse. I'm somebody. End of the fucking story."
"The love object is always a supporting character[...]
She delights, she entices, she is slender and beautiful and whimsical and invariably poorly written, and so many of us spend a great deal of time trying to be her.
Stories shape us, even the shit ones.
Even the ones that are simplistic and obviate a great deal of real-life experience by design.
Stories are how we organise our lives, how we streamline our desires, and sometimes they fall short, and sometimes they disappoint us, and they always matter.
For women, love stories are the stories we are allowed to cast ourselves in, and those are the stories that shape our cravings and identities."
-> They get me every fucking time (except the ones that are really really poorly written. Maybe I should move to Inverness as well^^)

"LoveTM is meant to be the overwhelming object of a woman's early life; her tory ends when she finds it, or fails to find it.
The most important thing is that her story ends."
"young men [...] have so many other stories to work with"
"Little girls, though, only ever get two choices: we can be the princess, or we can be the witch." //Actually, I think we could also be the fairy godmother (which is probably also the only positive narrative for an elderly woman who is not married)

"This is why female artists and women writers remain figures of suspicion.
Men are allowed to make their work, their practice, the central romance of their lives.
Men are allowed to love their art, their writing, their passion, a little bit more than anything else.
Women are not, and if we choose to do so anyway, we will always be seen as lacking something, or taking on a man's role, or both.
Whatever else we do with our lives, we must carve out part of our hearts in the service of others, or we are not really women.
We are permitted to be the wives and lovers of great men, but if we try to become great ourselves [..] there must be something wrong with us."


"I was a manic pixie dream girl"
-> yeah, me too

"Women behave in was that they find sanctioned in stories written by men who know better, and men and women seek out friends and partners who remind them of a girl they met in a book one day when they were young and longing."
"For me, Manic Pixie Dream Gril was the story that fit."
Following description on why -> adapt this
"I had the raw materials: I'm five feet nothing, petite and small-featured with skin the colour of something left on the bottom of a pond for too long and messy hair that's sometimes dyed a shocking shade of red or pink.
At least, it was before I washed all the dye out last year, partly to stop soulful Zach-Braff-a-likes following me to the shops.
And, yes, I'm a bit strange and sensitive and daydreamy, and, yes, I retain a somwhat embarassing belief in the ultimate decency of humanity and the transformative brilliance of music, lathough I'm ambivalent on the Shins.
I love to dance, I play the guitar badly, and I also — since we are in confession mode, dear reader, hear and forgive — I also play the fucking ukulele. Truly."
-> For the adaptation: I also have messy hair, which I hated when growing up bc it essentially allowed one hairstyle: this what my mother called " an unraveled basket" or "kicked around cabbage"; and in which at some point I started to take some weird pride, bc it was easier that way since it required zero action and it was something people seemed to like (which I was always kind of suspicious towards);
tried dying my hair pink, but never went the whole way of actually bleaching it first, partially out of fear that it'll fall out and partially out of plain old lazyness.
I did cut half of it once, due do a drunken bet though.
I play the guitar, or rather, used to, initially forced into it by my parents since "we have no space to put in a piano, but here's you father's old guitar" and rather lacklusterly; (which may have partially been due to the teachers who came from classical music and never seemed to have anything interesting to play) later; I took a liking to it, partially bc it seemed cool and you know "this is what girls fall for" (or maybe the boys?)
I walked around in middle school, the time when girls fought wars over Britney Spears vs Christina Agilera and Spice Girls vs Backstreet Boys, telling everyone that my favourite band was Queen, of which I've heard a grand total of 2 albums (or 3?), one of which was "Greatest Hits" (to be fair, I rather liked Queen and still do, so it was not a pose per se.)
I like to dance and sing, which I both do in a reasonably mediocre fashion, but it's fun.
In highschool, I went throught the obligatory phase of picking up street signs and cones and other random stuff of the streets and giving people cobble stones for their birthdays.
And of course, through the phase of doodling on your sneakers and drawing stuff on your own shirts (I even painted my prom dress).
And I also, "doubtless honed by that learned girlish desire to please", have always gone out of my way to include new people in groups.

"But the Manic Pixie is never a point-of-view character, and she isn't understood from the inside.
She's one of those female tropes who is permitted precisely no interiority.
Instead of a personality, she has eccentricities, a vaguely offbeat favourite band, a funky fringe."
"Most of the classic Manic Pixie Dream Girls claim to be ironic re-imaginings of a character trope that they fail to actually interrogate in any way.
Irony is, of course, the last vestige of modern crypto-misogyny: all those lazy stereotypes and hurtful put-downs are definitely a joke, right up until they aren't, and clearly youneed a man to tell you when and if you're supposed to take sexism seriously."
"Men write women, and they rewrite us, for revenge.
It's about obsession, and control."
"[...] Kazan told the Huffington Post.
'Everybody is setting out to write a full character.
It's just that some people are limited in their imagination of a girl. '


"She doesn't get a story. She is part of a story that happens to other people."
"Men grow up expecting to be the hero of their own story.
Women grow up expecting to be the supporting actress in somebody else's."
-> Vgl Daisy Jones. (Und Margarete Stokowski)

"If we want anything interesting at all to happen to us we have to be a story that happens to somebody else"

"Lady hobbits didn't bring the ring to Mordor. They stayed at home in the Shire."
-> Vlt kann man iwie die 20sec Zusammenschnitt of 2 women interacting in the whole LOTR trilogy einbauen.

"I was prepared for the personal to be political.
What I didn't understand until quite recently was that hte political can be so, so personal."

"a choice to stop being That Girl and start becoming a grown woman, which is the worst possible thing a girl can do, which is why so many of those Manic Pixie Dream Girl characters, as written by male geeks and scriptwriters, either die tragically young or are somehow immortally fixed at the physical and mental age of nineteen and a half.
Meanwhile, in th real world, the very worst thing about being a real-life MPDG is the look of disappointment on the face of someone you really care about when they find out you're not their fantasy at all — you're a real human who breaks wind and has a job."

"And it's a struggle.
Because I reamin a small, friendly, excitable person who wears withy colours and has a tendency towards the twee."

"So, here's what I've learned, in twenty-seven years of reading books and kissing boys.
Firstly, avaregely pretty white women in their late teens and twenties are not the biggest, most profoundly unsolvable mystery in the universe. [...]
Those of us with an ounce of lust for life are almost universally less interesting than we will be in our thirties and forties."
"The one abiding secret about us is that we're not fantasies, and we weren't made to save you: we are real people, with flaws and cracked personalities and big dreams and digetive tracts."

"Because it turns out that LoveTM is also the theoretical basis for most of the work done for free, largely by women, so that the mechanisms of profit and production can be maintained.
Most of the work of childcare, cooking, cleaning, personal care, helpmeeting and mopping up your husband's ego after a hard day's wage labour is not recognised as 'real work' because it is done out of 'love'"
"a lot of work that women do remains unpaid or underpaid because we think of it as 'love', as a moral expression of feelng rather than a practical task of immense and tangible value"

"For men, LoveTm is more likely to mean continuing in one's occupation of choice with the support of a partner who cherishes and believes in you, will take care of you when work exhausts you, will handle all the arrangements for the care and upbringing of your children so you don't have to hink about it, and will provide you with your preferredform of sexual release at the end of the working day."

".. and even a minority who work as primary carers for children, but that minority is still small — and enormously culturally underrepresented to the extent that such arrangements still fail to register in the life plans of most young men."
-- die dann auch krass gefeiert werden, dass sie ein bisschen Zeit mit ihren Kindern verbracht haben

"For men, love is supposedto be the reward you get in return for work; for women, love is work in itself."

"Marriage used to be understood as an essentially economic arrangement."-> vgl Amy March

On marriage:
"'the net effect of the neoliberal economic policies imposed in recent decades has been to push economic and social responsibility away from eployers and government and onto private households.[...] In more and more cases, the sole remaining resoure is the cooperative, mutually supporting household or kinship netowrk. 
But if marriage is the symbolic and legal anchor or households and kinship networks, and marriage is increasingly unstable, how relable will that source of support be?'" (quoting Richard Kim and Lisa Duggan from "Beyound Gay Marriage")

"Women learn to fear being 'left on the shelf', to associate it with poverty and isolation."

"We are all encouraged to feel sorry for ourselves if we are single, to consider ourselves incomplete, but women in particular are urged to consider themselves inferior if their time in not spent comforting and cosseting a man, and ideally, children too."
-- the two halves of an orange

"Your job is now your boyfriend: neither of them can be trusted to stick around, so you'd better make sure they know how much you love them."

"It's not that I don't believe in romantic love, in LoveTM.
It patently exists. People shape their lives to stories, and sometimes it works." 
-- and sometimes it doesn't^^, leaving you feeling inferior
"LoveTM is not true love, in the sense that many other kinds of love are also true."

"But the relatively recent cultural narrative of The One — the idea that everyone hasa soulamte whom they are destined to love for ever, and that your life will always be incomplete if you fail to meet, mate and move in with that person — that's not just implausible, it's cruel."
-- vgl "If there's only one person for you in the whole world and you lose them, does that mean that you have to live the rest of your life without anyone else? I think you, we, anyone, has to be open to possibilities"

"The people for whom LoveTm works [...] are in the minority.
Now that we are not obliged to choose between celibate loneliness and yoking ourselves for ever to a person we may grow to despise, most people's lives contain many important relationships, and sometimes those relationships fade or fizzle out.
That may not fit in with the dominant ideology — that monogamous marriage is the only possible healthy way to live,love and distribute welfare benefits — but it's a more accurate map of the human heart"

"No wonder increasing numbers of young people are exploring options — polyamory, open relationships, extended circles of chosen family and fuckbuddies"

"Fre love is love that is not co-opted or coerced, lovethat is not mutually oppressive, love that is not another word for work, duty and conformity."

"The idea that we have no control over who we love and what we do about it is one of the most disempowering things girls are ever told.
Loneliness is a fearful thing.
But a life lived grasping for another person to make you whole is just as fearful.
If you see yourself as incomplete without a partner to be your 'other half', you will always be lonely, even in a partnership."
//vgl Amy March; vgl two halves of an orange;


# Fazit

"If we want to escape the straitjacket of gender under neoliberalism, we must stop trying so hard to hold ourselves and others up to impossible standards, standards we didn't set ourselves.
We have to resist the schooled inner voice teling us to be good girls, tough boys, perfect women, strong men.
If we are to realise a greater collective humanity, we must learn to see one another as human beings first."

"We must refuse to judge others by any standard other than that of kindness and decency.
We must not start out by apologising for all that we are.
It's about saying no and expecting that no to be respected."

"Because when we are done hating oursleves and hurting each other, wecanget on with asking for what should be ours by right."
"Neoliberal patriarchy gives us choice, but not freedom."
"Feminism and radical politics are about demanding more than a choice between one type of servitude and another."
