Demographics:
from which (LA) countries do migrants come?
------------------------------------------

1990: Latinos are 20% of the population of NYC (approx. 2 mio) [Zentella90]

"The population of New York City  (NYC) in 2007 was 8.3 million;
the population of Latin American origin was 2.3 million, or 28 percent of the total (American Community Survey 2008, U.S. Census)
If undocumented  residents are included, Latinos may well account for a third of the city's population."[OtheguyZentella12]

->TODO: look up/include detailed census data
Wikipedia (what does census data say?)
Hispanics and Latinos make up 27.5% of New York City's population.
According to the American Community Survey, there were 2,287,905 Hispanic or Latino Americans residing in New York City.
The Hispanic/Latino population is categorized with four groups, "Puerto Rican" (785,618 or 9.4%), "Mexican" (297,581 or 3.6%), "Cuban" (42,377 or 0.5%), and "Other Hispanic or Latino" (1,165,576 or 14.0%).

According to the 2006-2007 Center for Latin American, Caribbean & Latino Studies:[50]
  Puerto Rican: (778,628)
  Dominican: (602,093)
  Mexican: (289,755)
  Ecuadorian: (201,708)
  Colombian: (113,469)
  Salvadoran:(100,396)
  Other Hispanic or Latino: (351,635)
(source: wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City, Originellquellen waren angegeben, aber Dokumente nicht mehr erreichbar)

Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Colombians, and Cubans arrived in the city at different periods and under
different circumstances.[Zentella90]
In addition to differences in population, periods of and reasons for migration, residential patterns, and
rates of intermarriage, other significant factors that affect intergroup contact and communication are
race, income, and education.[Zentella90]
Puerto Ricans were the first of these Spanish speaking groups to arrive in large
numbers, primarily in the post World War II decade, and the only ones to come from a territory that
belonged to the United States. Puerto Ricans come and go as U. S. citizens, and their migration
fluctuates in accordance with push pull influences of the mainland-vs.-island economy. [Zentella90]
Dominicans have the highest percent of mulattoes (77%),
Colombians and other South and Central Americans have the highest labor force participation rate (73.5),
and Cubans have the most education (19.8% with four years of college or more) and the highest median family income ($26,858).
Puerto Ricans are the most disadvantaged group of all:
they have the highest percent of persons who live below the poverty level (33.7%),
the lowest labor force participation rate (54.2%),
the least education (46% with less than 4 years of high school)
and the lowest median family income ($18,132)[Zentella90]


bilingualism:
-------------
"Also pointing to the bilingualism of NYC Latino communities (p.5) are census figures indicating
that 1.2 million (63 percent) of the 1.9 million census respondents who speak Spanish at
home also report that they speak English well or very well."


eher unüblich dass das Spanische für mehr als 2 Generationen beibehalten wird;
-> die Spanisch-sprachige Community beruht auf neue Migrationen
"there is every indication that the present-day vitality of Spanish in New York, strong as it is, lasts for only two generations in most families."[OtheguyZentella12]

"wawa" - Bus in PR, wild animal in Colombia
En la huelga de los trenes y me dice «Vamos a coger la wawa.» Y yo, yo la seguía pero yo no sabía.
¿La wawa? No, porque para no'tros es un animal. Y entonces yo le 'ij' «Pero mira que allí viene el bus
[Spanish] que me que pasa por mi casa.» Y dijo, «Sí, sí, en ese nos vamos.» «¿Pero no'ijiste que ibas a
coger la wawa?» Y entonces ya ella me explicó.[Zentella90]

* borrowings:
Puerto Ricans were the only participants who
sometimes borrowed the English words for #12 «vase» (phonologically adapted as [beis] or, rarely,
[base]) and for #s 19 and 20 in Category III, [ayglase(s)] «eyeglasses» [Zentella90]

auch solche, die ähnlich klingeln, aber auf spanisch ursprünglich eine andere Bedeutung haben
ZB "libreria" (Buchladen) für Bibliothek (library)

[Zentella90]
different Terms in the different Spanish varieties;

calques;

-> welche Wörter überleben? Diejenigen, die von den meisten SprecherInnengruppen geteilt werden?
Die von der prestige-tragendere Variante?
Die von der größten Sprecherinnengruppe? "The continued existence of both leading competitors for #s 21 and 22 is favored by the fact that the largest
group, Puerto Ricans, used both of them at similar rates: puerco (36%) and cerdo (37%), bodega (37%) and tienda (42%)."[Zentella90]
Diejenige, die die größten Ähnlichkeiten zum Englischen aufweist? (zb Col "bus", die Benutzung von overt preposited personal pronouns, etc.)
Or pick English variant to neutralize conflict between Spanish variants/avoid misunderstandings?

Dominicans did not produce any word that was favored by a majority of their
group only, but speakers from that country produced the most examples of words which the others did
not mention at all.[...] The majority of Dominicans did offer other more widely known words as
their everyday terms for these items. [Zentella90]

frequent vocabulary is more stable, infrequent vocabulary is «less stable, more subject to oblivion and
replacement» (Weinreich: 57).
These words are linked to everyday activities, but
they are used infrequently today in New York City because the items themselves are going out of style,
given the advent of blowdried hairdos and automatic clothes driers

personal pronouns
--> tendency for frontloading of personal pronouns in turns and utterances (till now no variants variation)
"For  example,  the tendency  we  have  already discussed for the pronoun to  be
present when  a participant is  first mentioned and for it  to  be  absent  in  subsequent
references  to  the same  person  appears as  a straightforwardly motivated phenomenon" [OtheguyZentella12]

Caribbean variants use more frontloading of personal pronouns


* overt personal pronouns vs null pronouns [OtheguyZentella12]

1a. [Question is  whether baseball  players in  the U.S deserve to  make  such  high
salaries.]  Yo  creo  que ellos son buenos. Aunque  yo  no  sé  mucho de  deporte pero
cuando  los veo por la  televisión, parecen ser buenos  ... porque  como  que ellos han
estudiado tanto y son campeones,  creo  que sí  se  lo  merecen [003U].
‘I  think that  they  are good. Although  I don’t know  much  about sports  but when  [I]
see them  on  TV, [they]  seem  good  ... because they  have  studied so  much  and
[they]  are champions,  [I] think that  [they]  do  deserve it.’

For example,  in  the actual  usage in  1a, the speaker first
refers  to  the baseball  players using a pronoun (ellos  son buenos, “they are good”)  and
then  uses  a verb  without a pronoun for the next  mention (parecen  ser buenos, “[they]
seem  to  be  good”). This  pattern is  repeated  in  the next  sentence, by  using a pronoun for
the first mention of  the players (ellos  han estudiado,  “they have  studied”) and then
omitting  it  for the next  two mentions  (son  campeones and se  lo  merecen,  “[they] are
champions and [they]  deserve it”).[OtheguyZentella12]
"This tendency
toward  front-loading the occurrence  of  pronouns  in  turns and utterances, and to  first
using the pronoun and then  leaving it  out,  is  strong  in  Spanish,"[OtheguyZentella12]

Caribbean variants use more pronouns than mainland
"Notice,  in  1a, the consistent  use of  subject personal  pronouns  by  the Dominican
Of  the nineteen  eligible  verbs in  this  Caribbean passage,  eight have  a pronoun (a  42
percent rate  for this  passage). In  contrast, the Ecuadorian  in  1b  makes spare use of
pronouns; of  the eleven  eligible  verbs in  1b, only  two have  a pronoun (an 18  percent rate
for this  passage)."
1a. [Incidents  when  learning  to  milk  cows].  Cuando  yo  aprendí.  Con doce  años  y
me  mandaban  a ordeñar una cantidad  de  vacas por la  mañana. De  cuando
regresábamos  para  atrás—y una vez nosotros  nos fuimos  a ordeñar mi  hermano y
yo  ... Cuando  fuimos  y odeñamos  siete vacas,  venimos,  cuando  veníamos  tenía tres
días  lloviendo y estaba  muy resbaloso y yo  resbalé que venía con,  con una lata  de
leche como  con quince  o dieciséis litros  de  leche,  y resbalé y se  botaron todos,  y
nosotros, “Ay,  y ¿cómo nosotros  vamos a llegar  a la  casa?”  que “Hoy  me  mata  mi
mamá,”  y “Ay,  ¿cómo lo  vamos a hacer?” Cuando  llegamos, nosotros  le  dijimos a mi
mamá  lo  que había pasado  y ella  no  nos lo  creía y entonces  mi  papá  dijo, “Pero que
esos  muchachitos no  se  podían  mandar  hoy a ordeñar hoy,  ¿Por  qué no  me
llamaste  para  ir  yo  o fuiste  tú, eso fue que tú  sabes como  es  que está  el  día y eso,
hoy no  estaba  de  esos  muchachitos ir  a ordeñar.” [125D]
‘When I learned.  At  age 12, and [they]  sent  me  to  milk  a lot of  cows  in  the morning.
When  [we]  got back—and  once  we  went  to  milk  my  brother and I ... When  [we]
went  and [we]  milked  seven cows, [we]  came, when  [we]  came  it  had been  raining
for three days  and it  was very  slippery  and I slipped that  [I] was coming  with, with
a can of  milk  like  with  fifteen or  sixteen liters  of  milk, and [I] slipped and everything
spilled and we, “Oh,  How are we  going to  go  home?”  that  “Today  my  mother  will  kill
me,”  and “Oh,  what  are [we]  going to  do.”  When  [we]  arrived,  we  told  our mother
what  had happened  and she did not believe us  and then  my  father  said, “But  those
kids  should  not have  been  sent  to  milk  today.  Why didn’t  [you] call  me  for me  to  go,
or  why didn’t  you go? That's  because you know  what  the weather is  like  today and
it  was not for those children  to  go  milking today.” ’

  1b. [Interviewer  asks  about whether there is  a social  life  at  school].  No, ¿a  qué
  hora? No. Voy,  o sea,  llego del trabajo y me  voy a la  universidad,  y es, es
  diferente,  no  es  como  antes (p.75)   que  uno iba y habían  amigos  ahí,  y ..  y se  veían
  entre el  día,  es  diferente,  todos son adultos,  todos tienen  su  vida  y es, uno entra,
  oye la  clase,  las notas,  lo  que sea,  okay, chao  y nos vamos,  o sea,  no  es, no  es  que,
  “Okay,  llámame o ... o te  veo más tarde”, o “te veo en  otra  clase”, sino  que es . . es
  muy diferente.  [326E]
  ‘No,  at  what  time? [I] go, that  is  [I] arrive  from  work  and [I] go  to  the university,
  and it's  different,  it's  not like  before  that  one would go  and there were  friends
  there and ... and [they]  saw each  other during  the day,  [they]  are all adults, all
  have  their life  and it's, one goes  in, listens to  the class,  the notes,  whatever, ok,
  bye,  and [we]  leave,  that  is, it's  not,  “Ok,  call  me” or  ... “[I]  will  see you later”, or
  “[I]  will  see you in  another class,” but rather  it's . . it's very  different. ’

Possible conclusions:
-> Caribbean variants have more pronouns, because considered less prestigious, thus greater convergence towards English (pronouns are obligatory)
-> Caribbean variants have more pronouns, because speakers have lived longer in the US (however Spanish loss after 2 generations)
-> Caribbean variants have more pronouns, because of phonological features (e.g. final s deletion, which makes it difficult to understand the semantics without pronouns)
-> Tendency: Consistent with  a dialectal leveling
hypothesis, the differences in  pronoun rates between newcomers from  the Caribbean
and newcomers from  the Mainland  have  narrowed  among Caribbeans  and Mainlanders
of  the second  generation. [OtheguyZentella12]
-> Bilinguals/speakers more proficient in English use more pronouns than newcomers: bestätigt die English Influnece Hypothese [OtheguyZentella12]

* preplacement of overt personal pronouns vs postplacement [RanaRisso10]

"This alterntion between preposed and postposed overt subject pronouns is found in all varieties of Spanish,
and it is very likely that it responds to linguistic-internal and speaker-external conditioning variables."[RanaRisso10]
"..in Spanish overwhelming majority of subject pronouns are preposed to the verb, there are severa specific linguistic environments where,
according to the research literature, postposition is preferred."
-> interrogative pronoun introducing a question
-> intransitive verb
-> sentence includes a relative clause

"It has also been claimed that there are dialectal differences in pronoun placement between the Caribbean and the Latin American Mainland."[RanaRisso10]

"..in the Caribbean, overt pronominal subjects may be preposed in subordinate clauses with non-finite verbs as in 2),
while other varieties of Spanish require postposition, as in 3)" [RanaRisso10]
  2) Dejé     ver     la cicatriz para yo (underlined) saber (bold)  cómo es eso
    Allowed-I to show the scar    for  I (underlined) to know (bold) how that is
    'I allowed the scar to show, for me to know how it looks like'

  3) El decir(bold)lo    tú(underline)   y    entender(bold)lo       yo(underline) ...
     For to say(bold)-it you (unterline) and  to understand(bold)-it I(underline)
     'For you to say it and for me to understand it...'

direct questions that start with an interrogative pronoun -> "traditionally, authors have noted that postposition is required in such interrogatives."
-> in the Caribbean preposition is favored:

4) ¿Qué tú(underline)  quieres(bold)?
   What you(underline) want(bold)?
   'What do you want?'

 Hypothesis:
->"dialectal differences in the speech of newcomers to the City from Latin America
(more preposing in the speech of Caribbeans than in that of Mainlanders)"
-> "I also expect that as these newcomers are exposed to speakers from other parts of Latin America,
these initial dialectal differences will, with the passing of time, be leveled out."
-> "I expect that, with the passage of time spent in New York, as Spanish-speakers become more and more exposed to English,
patterns of English usage will affect their Spanish, leading to an increase not only in the occurrence rate of overt pronouns
but also in that of preposed pronouns." [RanaRisso10]

Studie:
* dependent variable: use of preposed pronouns
* independent variables: overall rate of overt pronouns use; region of origin; exposure group (NY raised, newcomers, immigrants)

"Caribbean Spanish allows preposed pronouns where other dialects of Spanish have a null or a posposed subject" [RanaRisso10]
"Caribbeans use more overt pronouns than Mailanders and they prepose their overts more than Mainlanders." [RanaRisso10]
"Caribbean Spanish behaves more like English and less like Mainland Spanish."
"second-generation participants (NYR) have higher rates of preposed pronouns than first-generation ones...
and that there is also an increase within the first generation, immigrants showing a higher preposed rate than newcomers."
"the more years of their lives the speakers spend in NY, the higher the rate of preposed pronouns"

Leveling Or Contact
-------------------
[Zentella90] Fragestellung:
"we sought to investigate whether each group maintained its country's regional lexicon,
assimilated that of the largest Spanish speaking group in the city or the most prestigious variety,
or produced another, «New Yorker Spanish» lexicon"


* influence of the social network:
"dense and multiplex social networks typical of working class communities (Milroy 1987). Those
networks help maintain the ways of speaking of the homeland, as do frequent telephone calls, visits, and visitors." [Zentella07]
"Although overt norms favor standard speech, powerful covert norms encourage
group members to remain faithful to group codes, linguistic and otherwise." [Zentella07]

* language prestige (between Spanish varieties, Spanish/English)
"radical" Caribbean Spanish vs "conservative" mainland/highland Spanish (nearer to the Castilian norm)

** verbunden mit außersprachlichen Faktoren: class, race, gender, generation:
Dominican variant: less prestigious, people considered most "black" (race)
"race has been remapped from biology onto language"[Zentella07]
"'Incorrect' aspects of grammar or pronunciation label their speakers as inferior" [Zentella07]
persistent foreign accents in English are punished, people viewed as "unwilling to assimilate";
view promoted by media and public institutions;
-> eine Sprachpolitik, die sehr aufs Erhalten des Englischen (das gar nicht gefährdet ist) konzentriert ist;
und Sprecherinnen anderer Sprachen ziemlich krass diskriminiert -> linguistic intolerance

Puerto Rican variant: less prestigious, people are poorest (class)
Andererseits: PR are the biggest hispanic group and US citizens -> other migrants would adopt their variant
Cubans are more educated, higher social status -> greater linguistic security
"Puerto Ricans and Dominicans are the poorest, the least educated, and the darkest
Latinos in the city; they are discriminated against as individuals and as a group, and so is the variety of
Spanish that they speak" [Zentella90]
** sprachliche Features: sounds ugly or incorrect
"widespread rejection of Dominican Spanish" [Zentella90]
"This affirmation of dialect pride is in contrast to the negative Dominican evaluations of their dialect,
e.g., 80% believe that their Spanish should not be taught in schools, 35% of these because it is
«incorrecto» or «malo»" [Zentella90]

* linguistic capital
"the power of dominant definitions of linguistic capital. All talk,
especially with outsiders, involves placing the interlocutor on a linguistic ladder
with rungs linked to ethnic, racial, gender, and class status, and the values of
insiders and outsiders often conflict"[Zentella07]
"But conflict between in-group and out-group pressures does not begin in the United States.
Immigrants arrive with Latin American notions of good and bad language
that reflect the class, racial, and ethnic divides of their homelands, resulting in
entrenched beliefs regarding:
1) the superiority of the Spanish of Spain and the local “norma culta,” particu-
larly of highland South American dialects;
2) the destructive influence of English on Spanish and on Latin American
national identity" [Zentella07]


-> Zentellas Konzept "linguistic insecurity": "consider their dialect inferior to others"[Zentella07]

* avoiding misunderstandings : try to pick neutral terms when talking to out-group members:
The speakers' in-group casual conversations revealed that
informal situations are most likely to produce the regional variants, but each group also has access to
the more general lexical item for formal and/or out-group settings. [Zentella90]

* style/Sozioindexikalität: adopt linguistic forms of groups one sympathises with/has intense relationships with
"I have found conservative speakers who
became radical speakers because of their identification with a group of radical speakers, either because
of personal relationships, e.g., some Mexicans who married into Puerto Rican families, or political
ideology, e.g., South American community workers in Dominican neighborhoods." [Zentella90]
"using the appropriate forms that allow them to express different «acts
of identity» (Le Page and Tabouret Keller 1985) in different settings/situations" [Zentella90]

* faktoren in conflict:
** more spread vs less prestigious
** less correct vs covertly associated with masculinity and toughness
"Thus, although the pronunciation of -s is lauded overtly as correct in the Dominican
community, its deletion may be linked covertly to masculinity, and being down to earth." [Zentella90]

* Spanglish
"Powerful socioeconomic and cultural forces stimulate borrowing whenever two cultures are in contact;
the borrowing by the subordinate group's language from that of the dominant group is always
significantly greater" [Zentella90]
Factors, which facilitate borrowings:[Zentella90]
 1) Most items reflect a cultural reality that is new or different, e.g., [kei/keike/keiki]
 «cake», [bobipín] «bobby pin», [ŷins/bluŷines] «(blue)jeans.»
 2) Others may be facilitated or even triggered by a similarity in the phonological and/or morphological
 structure of a word in the dominant language that makes it sound like a possible subordinate word,
 matre(s) «mattress» is similar to that of madre(s) «mother(s).
 3) reduction in the number of syllables, e.g., [beis] replaces florero for «vase»
 4) prestige
 5) Anglicisms can play the role of neutralizer between competing dialectal variants because the
 prestigious outside language acts as the lingua franca that resolves the conflict without favoring one
 group at the expense of the other.

 "but it seems that the longer a group has been in the U.S., the less they use the homeland's term"
 "second generation Cubans incorporated more loans in their speech than members of the first generation."
 "Language proficiency appears to be a more relevant factor than age" [Zentella90]

 bilinguals viewed as "linguistically deficient and cognitively confused"[Zentella07] by both English and Spanish speakers
 "on Christina, a popular talkshow, 'Spanglish errors' are beeped, like obscenities" [Zentella07]
 "white sells" -> not only skin color but also remapped onto language: "la norma culta"

 "Spanish accent in English is laughable"[Zentella07]

 "destructive influence of English" -> derrogative terms for returnees
 "The labels suggest a hybrid – and therefore
 presumably confused and incomplete – identity, reflected in linguistic deficiency"[Zentella07]
 "The right to claim a legitimate Puerto Rican or
 Mexican identity is based partly on the extent to which your Spanish is free
 from English." -> controversial since "knowedge of English represents significant capital"[Zentella07]

* influence of the media: "they do contribute to popular acceptance and use of some new vocabulary" [Zentella90]
(siehe oben bei Spanglish)

Angleichen mit der Terminologie, die im Seminar ausgearbeitet wurde!

* Inter-dialectal leveling (glaub, kam im Seminar nicht vor)
"According to Milroy (2002), the difference between dialect levelling and koinéization is that dialect levelling involves the eradication of linguistic variants due to language contact while koinéization involves the creation of a new linguistic variety based on language contact."(wikipedia)

"Dialectal  leveling  is  most  useful
as  an  explanatory construct when, as  in  Kerswill  (2002:675), it  is  applied to  an
intermediate  point between noncontact  reference situations  and fully developed stages  of
koineization  in  which new,  focused forms of  speech, often described as  simplified  or
reduced when  compared  with  the reference lects,  have  developed." [OtheguyZentella12]

Background Data einzelner Papers:

[Zentella90]
* Fragestellung:
"we sought to investigate whether each group maintained its country's regional lexicon,
assimilated that of the largest Spanish speaking group in the city or the most prestigious variety,
or produced another, «New Yorker Spanish» lexicon"
* Methode:
We asked 194 Hispanics (73 Puerto Ricans, 51 Colombians, 50
Dominicans, and 20 Cubans, see Table I in Appendix) to identify 25 objects, presented in drawings, as
part of a 1-2 hour sociolinguistic interview adapted from Labov (1984)59. The items included common
objects which are lexically different for one or more of the nationalities studied. Interviewees were
asked how they referred to each item in everyday conversation, and whether or not they knew of any
other group's term for it.
* Befunde:
we found that differences in age, gender, education,
years in the US., and Spanish or English proficiency, largely proved insignificant in determining the
subjects' responses. National origin determines their choice of vocabulary, with some revealing
additions and exceptions.
Possible outcomes
-> all groups have the same term (collar, cadena, cartera)
-> 3 groups have the same, the 4th has another (naranja vs china in PR, escritorio vs buró Cu, guagua vs bus Col)
-> 2 groups have the same, the other 2 have another one, or 2 different
* Data:
ziemlich inkonsistent; Prozente addieren sich zu >100, andere Probleme..
