% Interference bei Weinreich
\cite{Weinreich79} ``... discussed how two language systems relate to each other in the mind of the same individual.
The key concept was interference, defined as ``those instances of deviation from the norms of either language which occur in the speech of bilinguals as a result of ther familiarity with more than one language'' \cite{Weinreich79} '' \cite{Cook93}
\footnote{Erste Veröffentlichung dieser Schrift erfolgt bereits in 1953}

can happen on all levels of a language:
\begin{itemize}
    \item phonology: ``Speakers may carry over the L1 phonological system by ignoring distinctions made in the L2 but not in the L1;'' \cite{Cook93}
        ``some French learners fail to distinguish between the two English phonemes /i:/ and /i/ as in ``keen'' /ki:n/ and ``kin'' /kin/ because they are not distinct in their L1.''

        \cite{Weinreich79} `` For example, neither French nor Russian have /\textipa{D}, $\theta$/ phonemes, but in contact
        with English, French speakers tend to render /\textipa{D}, $\theta$/ as [z, s], while Russian
        speakers generally pronounce [d, t].
        In other words, the French perceive the continuance of /\textipa{D}, $\theta$/ which distinguishes them from /d, t/ as most relevant, while
        the Russians consider the mellowness of /\textipa{D}, $\theta$/ which distinguishes them from /dz, ts/ as decisive.''


    \item word order: ``German learners of English produce ``Yesterday came he'' modelled on the equivalent German sentence ``Gestern kam er''.''

        \cite{Weinreich79} ``(1) The replica of the relation of another language explicitly conveys an unintended meaning.
        Example: A German speaker says in English `this woman loves the man' on the model of German
        `diese Frau liebt der Mann', intending to communicate the message `the man
        loves this woman', but producing the opposite effect.
        (2) The replica of the relation of another language violates an existing relation pattern, producing
        nonsense or a statement which is understandable by implication.
        Example: A German speaker says in English `yesterday came he' on the model of German
        `gestern kam er', meaning `he came yesterday'.''


\end{itemize}

% Transfer bei Lado
In \cite{Lado71} The ``fundamental assumption'' is transfer;``individuals tend to transfer the forms and meanings, and the distribution of forms and meanings of their native language and culture to the foreign language and culture'' (in der 1. Auflage, s.2)
\footnote{Ähnlich wurde das Buch ... zum ersten Mal in 1957 veröffentlicht}

``Robert Lado proposed in his
Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH) (Lado 1957): ‘We assume that the
student who comes in contact with a foreign language will find some features
of it quite easy and others extremely difficult. Those elements that are similar
to his native language will be simple for him, and those elements that
are different will be difficult’ (Lado 1957: 2)'' (in \cite{Ellis06})


According to \cite{Cook93}: ``In this view L2 learning consists largely of the projection of the system of the L1 on to the L2.
This will be successful when the two languages are the same -- called ``positive'' transfer by some;
it will be unsuccessful whenever the L2 fails to correspond to the L1 -- ``negative'' transfer.''

Adoption of a L1 rule in the IL grammar:
``I go not to school'' German-speaking L2 learners of English ``reflecting the post-verbal negation structure
of the German L1 (``Ich gehe nicht in die Schule'')''

Lado according to \cite{Braidi99}:
Similar structures are easily transfered from L1 in L2;
``structures could be similar in 3 ways: they could be signalled by the same formal device, have the same meaning,
or have a similar distribution in the language system'' (Lado 1957: 66)

``The student tends to transfer the sentence forms, modification devices, the number, gender and case patterns of
his native language.'' (Lado 1957: 58)

``Transfer is the influence resulting from similarities and differences between the target language and any other
language that has been previously (and perhaps imperfectly) acquired'' (Odlin 1989: 27 Language Transfer: Cross-linguistic Influence in Language Learning
JFK F 107.4/ O 24)

% Übergeneralisierung

\cite{Braidi99}
``... English-speaking L2 learners of Spanish may overgeneralize the usage of present progressive to indicate a
future event, an inappropriate context for this structure in Spanish (*``Estoy saliendo mañana''/``I am leaving tomorrow''
for ``Voy a salir mañana.'')


\subsection{Kognitivlinguistische/Konstruktionsgrammatische Perspektive}

%zum Erklären vom Transfer
\cite{Ellis06} ``Interference theory primarily concerned the transfer of the content of
associations. But more recent analyses demonstrate how from content, given
enough of it, emerges principle, how form–meaning mappings conspire in
biasing attention and process. As a ubiquitous process of learning, transfer
pervades all language learning.''

--> es bildet sich also bei wiederholtem Transfer eine Gewohnheit heraus -> wird dann schwieriger die tatsächlichen Cues zu merken und die ``falsche'' Variante bürgert sich ein;
der Transfer erschwert also das Lernen

``If a referent already has an associated name, it is harder to
attach a new name to it.''
-- bezieht sich auch wenn das Wort in der L1 schon existiert, ist es schwer das mit einer neuen Bedeutung in der L2 zu erlernen; bzw meistens ist die L1 Bedeutung, die als erste aufgerufen wird

`` when two cues are presented together and they
jointly predict an outcome [...] the most salient cue becoming associated with the
outcome and the less salient one being overshadowed''

`` Forms that have not
previously cued particular interpretations are harder to learn as cues when
they do become pertinent later.''

``L2 acquisition is clearly affected by the transfer
of learners’ knowledge of their first language.''

%        ``preservation and transfer: failing to notice that a feature needs to processed in a different new way --> distorting the preception of items in their vicinity to make them seem more similar to the prototype''
%--> Grund für Transfer

%aber auch : wenn die cues nicht auffällig sind und es sich mehrere Form-Repräsentationen für die selbe Bedeutung etabliert haben;
%transfer
%In \cite{Ellis06}: ``when multiple
%traces are associated to the same cue, they tend to compete for access to
%conscious awareness'' --> reason for transfer

%oder wenn nicht genug Input vorhanden und wegen mangelndem Input die L1 Variante übernommen wird.


%Transfer + Übergeneralisierung
``Taylor investigated
the English of elementary and intermediate native Spanish speaking ESL
students. He analyzed their errors in the Auxiliary and Verb Phrases of eighty
sentences, categorizing them into those errors that resulted from L1 transfer,
and those that resulted from overgeneralization of L2 patterns.
[...] with transfer
errors more prevalent among elementary students (40 percent) than
intermediate students (23 percent), and overgeneralizations more prevalent
in intermediate (77 percent) than elementary students (60 percent).''

\cite{Taylor75}
``The overgeneralization and transfer learning strategies
appear to be two distinctly different linguistic manifestations of
one psychological process: reliance on prior learning to facilitate
new learning.''

``The strategy of syntactic overgeneralization can be defined as
a process in which a language learner uses a syntactic rule of the
target language inappropriately when he attempts t o generate a
novel target language utterance. Errors which seem t o reflect an
overgeneralization strategy suggest three important facts about a
learner’s knowledge of the syntax of the target language:
1. The learner has mastered the mechanics of a particular
syntactic rule of the target language.
2. The learner does not know how to use the rule appropri-
ately; i.e., he has not learned the distribution of the rule or the
exceptional cases where the rule does not apply.
3. The learner is an active participant in the language
acquisition process and is exercising his already acquired knowledge
of the target language in a creative way; he is neither operating
under a repetition or imitation strategy, nor transferring native
language structures in his target language attempts.''

%Overshadowing
``Overshadowing as it plays out over time produces a type of learned
selective attention known as blocking. Chapman and Robbins (1990) showed
how a cue that is experienced in a compound along with a known strong
predictor is blocked from being seen as predictive of the outcome.''

``Not only are many grammatical meaning–form relationships low in salience,
but they can also be redundant in the understanding of the meaning of
an utterance.''

``Schumann (1987) describes how L2 temporal reference is initially made exclusively
by use of devices such as temporal adverbials [...] with the grammatical expression of tense and aspect emerging only
slowly thereafter (Bardovi-Harlig 2000)''

%Blocking
``Thus, another pervasive reason for the non-acquisition of low salience cues
in L2 acquisition is that of blocking, where redundant cues are overshadowed
for the historical reasons that the learners’ first language experience leads
them to look elsewhere for their cues to interpretation.''

``The usual pedagogical reactions to these situations of overshadowing or
blocking involve some means of retuning selective attention, some type of
form-focused instruction or consciousness raising (Sharwood-Smith 1981) to
help the learner to ‘notice’ the cue and to raise its salience.''

%Categorization

%``Whereas the associative learning effects detailed above relate to specific cues
%or constructions and their interpretations, perceptual learning is more to do
%with the organization of the whole system''

``As more and more instances are processed,
so the representations of these exemplars become sorted and positioned in
psychological space so that similar items are close together and dissimilar
ones are far apart.''

``human categorization
research evidencing attention shifts toward the use of dimensions that are
useful for the tasks in hand [...] learners
become more sensitive to these dimensions and are better able to make
discriminations involving them.''

``Early, balanced simultaneous bilingual
simulations showed the clearest evidence of language separation: through
self-organization, the network comes to separate the Chinese lexicon from
the English lexicon, implicating distinct lexical representations for the
two languages. In the DevLex model, less balanced or later L2 input
produce representations whereby L2 is partially parasitic on L1, and adult
second-language simulations show relatively little L1–L2 separation at a local
level and maximal transfer and interference.''
