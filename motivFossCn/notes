FOSS Motivation
===============

Allgemeine Gedanken/Kommentare


*(Am Rand: Ich glaube, alle Papers beschäftigen sich mit der Motivation von Entwickler*innen; allerdings gibt es auch andere Möglichkeiten zu FOSS-Projekten beizutragen; zb Userdocumentation; Publicity; Design; ..)

* viele Papers machen die Dichotomie intrinsic/extrinsic motivation auf; ich finde allerdings, dass beide öfters schwierig von einander abzugrenzen sind und wir in vielen Fällen viel mehr von einem Kontinuum anstatt von diskreten Werten ausgehen sollten

* Struktur/Leitfaden für später
  ** einzelne Motivationen aufzählen
  ** wo wurden sie erwähnt
  ** welche Perspektive vertreten die entsprechenden Papers im allgemeinen (eher wirtschaftlich/sozialwissenschaftlich/psychologisch/..)
  ** wie wurden die Ergebnisse erhoben --> was für Auswirkungen hat das auf die Ergebnisse?
     (wer hat wen gefragt und was genau/wie wurde gefragt; haben die Fragenden die Fragen so gestellt, damit die Antworten, die sie erwartet haben, gegeben werden?)
  ** welche Faktoren sind FOSS/WCN gemeinsam; welche sind anders

[HarOu2002]

2 broad categories:
* internal factors (e.g. intrinsic motivation, altruism)
* external rewards (e.g. expected future returns, personal needs)

general asumption:
``Typically,
open-source software is developed by an Internet-based community of pro-
grammers. Participation is voluntary, and participants do not receive direct
compensation for their work.''
(but is it still the case? article was published 2002 nevertheless..)

``In addition, the entire source code is made
available to the public. The developers devolve most of the property rights
to the public, including the right to use, redistribute, and modify the soft-
ware free of charge.''
--> can we derive motivations here for?

``Its pro-
ponents regard it as a paradigmatic change whereby the economics of private
goods, built on the scarcity of resources, is replaced by the economics of pub-
lic goods, where scarcity is not an issue.''
--> advocating for a new economy model? smash capitalism^^?

--> there is a questionaire at the end of the paper

Motivation in general
* ``Maslow
identified five needs that drive human activities, ranging from physiological
needs to the need for self-actualization [16].''
* Deci: intrinsic motivation (``desire to feel competent and self-determined.'')<-->  external factors (``direct or indirect monetary compensation, and
recognition by others.'') [6]
* ``Herzberg, who views motivation as a func-
tion of three factors: ability of the individual over potential, ability over ability,
and reinforcement behavior [11]''
* Klandermans: ``distinguishes social motivations, collective motivations,
and reward motivations [14].''
* Maslow: self-actualization needs (intrinsic) and esteem needs:“desire for a stable, firmly
based, usually high evaluation of [oneself]” [16, p. 21]. (desires for recognition, fame, and reputation -> external)


Internal factors
* ``feelings of competence, satisfaction, and fulfillment that arise from writing programs.''
* altruism: ``“doing something for another at some cost to oneself” [18, p. 5].
Since open-source programmers provide something for others (writing pro-
grams with open-source code) at their own expense (time, energy, opportu-
nity costs, etc.), they belong to this category''
* community identification: ``It corresponds to Maslow’s needs for belonging and love.''
  ** align their goals with those of the community.
  ** teach other members of the community “kin-selection altruism”

External Rewards

Future Rewards
* ``may obtain indirect rewards by increasing their
marketability and skill base or by selling related products and services.''
* view their participation as future investment
* Revenues from Related Products and Services: e.g. commercial consulting, training, distribution, support,
and implementation services
--> boundaries sometimes fuzzy
--> sometimes competening needs: improving the software declines the need for support
* Human Capital: expanding the personal skill base -> leads to ``better job opportunities, higher
salaries, and more fulfilling jobs''
  ** open source code allows to choose project according to the skills one wants to improve
  ** allow entry level programmers to participate in real projects (<-- das würde ich fast hinterfragen^^)
* Self-Marketing: ``effective way to demonstrate their capabilities and skills''
  ** ``good advertising channel for those seeking to advance in the programming field.'' <-- die Lebenslaufkategorie
* Peer Recognition
  ** feedback (also learning): ``open-source programmers receive rapid, constructive feedback about the quality of their work.''
  ** recognition, someone is using the software

Personal Needs
* developers program a software they personally need (historical examples: Perl, Apache Web Server)

Free vs Commercial Software
``The more complex a product is, and the less dependent on other software modules [...] the more likely
that programmers will sell their software''

Results of the empirical survey
-------------------------
* 79 reponses
* 95% male
* 1/4 without college education
* 1/2 working as programmers
* 16% paid directly for developing open source
* >1/2 participate in more than 1 project
* 85% 20-40 years
* 16% rated high on altruism
* 30% identify strongly with the open-source community/have kinlike relationships with open source programmers
* 14% (want to) sell related products or services
* 50% wanted to improve their programming skills
* several wanted to improve other skills: ``learn english and teamwork''
* several do it because it ``demonstrates my abilities'' or ``I can use it as a reference''
* 52% "because I build a network of peers"
* ``hope to gain positive reputation''
* ``develop tools I need to do my job''/''need the...''

* ``Hobbyists and students were the most internally motivated''
* ``Students and hobby programmers seemed to be more strongly motivated by altruism and community identification.''
* ``Salaried and contract programmers, in contrast, hoped to sell related products and services.''
* ``Surprisingly, for this group determination and peer recognition needs correlated negatively with level of effort.''
* developers paid for open source: ``most concerned with self-marketing and
fulfilling their personal software needs''

[LakWo2005]

nothing really breath-taking;
general impression: swappy editing (typos, grammar incongruencies); illogical arguments sometimes;
web-based survey

* 3 general motivation categories
  ** intrinsic, flow/creativity based
  ** extrinsic (career advancement, payment) --> economic in essence
  ** intrisic, community obligation (acting out of principle; returning something to the foss community; foss rocks; identification with the foss community..)
---> table 6 for more detailed summary of motivations (+ some percentages)


``flow'':
``enjoyment is maximized, characterized by intense and focused concentration; a
merging of action and awareness; confidence in one’s ability; and the enjoyment of the activity
itself regardless of the outcome''
``Flow states occur a person’s skill matches the challenge of a task. [...]
A task that is beyond the skill of an individual will provoke anxiety, and a task
that is below the person’s skill level will induce boredom.''
``Thus F/OSS participants may be
seeking flow states by selecting projects that match their skill levels with task difficulty, a choice
that may not be available in their regular jobs''

extrinsic motivation:
immediate and delayed payoffs (gibts schon iwo anders auch)
* immediate: being paid to participate; user need for particular software
* delayed: career advancement (job market signaling); improving programming skills (human capital)
``Participants indicate
to potential employers their superior programming skills and talents by contributing code to
projects where their performance can be monitored by any interested observer''

payment:
``The combination of those who received direct financial compensation
and those whose supervisors knew of their work on the project created a category of “paid
contributors” consisting of approximately 40% of the sample.''
``Overall, paid contributors are spending more than two working days a week and
volunteer contributors are spending more than a day a week on F/OSS projects.''
--> später wird das als Argument für Produktivität oder so herangezogen, was ich bisschen absurd finde;
klar, können Menschen, die dafür bezahlt werden, sich mehr damit beschäftigen, die anderen müssen immer noch auch Lohnarbeit verrichten..

* previous work
  ** states that previous work has found mostly extrinsic motivation (better jobs, career advancement)

* findings (short version):
  ** motivation is heterogeneous combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors (enjoyment based intrinsic motivation is prevailing)
  ** intrinsic/extrinsic do not compete against or diminish each other (contrary to established psychology findings)
  ** sense of flow/creativity/enjoyment is primary motivation

Findings (longer version, some quotes; see also table 6 of the paper):
* user need: ``User needs for the software, both work and nonwork-related, combine to be the
overwhelming reason for contribution and participation (von Hippel 1988, 2001, 2002), with
more than 58% of participants citing them as a important.''
* enjoyment: ``The top single reason to contribute to projects is based on enjoyment-related intrinsic
motivation: “Project code is intellectually stimulating to write” (44.9%)''
* improving programming skills : ``Improving programming
skills, an extrinsic motivation related to human capital improvement, was a close second, with
41.8% of participants saying it was an important motivator.''
(ich finde "intellectual stimulation" und "improving programming skills" recht schwierig von einander abzugrenzen)
* identification with open source values: ``Approximately one-third of our sample indicated that the belief that “source code should
be open,” an obligation/community motivation, was an important reason for their participation.''
* identification with the hacker community: (wird nicht in der summary tabelle aufgelistet.. eine weitere Inkonsistenz)
``Another sou rce of an obligation/community motivation is the level of identification felt
with the hacker community. Self-identification with the hacker community and ethic should
drive participation in projects. Respondents to our survey indicated a strong sense of g roup
identification with 42% indicating that they “strongly agree” and another 41% “somewhat agree”
that the hacker community is a primary source of their identity''
* ``It is consistent for someone paid to participate in the F/OSS movement to be moved by the political
goals of free software and open code.''
--> jo, auf jeden Fall, man kann sich auch nur durch Läden einstellen lassen, dir für die Entwiklung eben solcher Software zahlen

top motivations:
* for paid contributors: ``work-related user need (56%) and value professional status (22.8%)''
* for volunteers: ``improve their skills (45.8%) or need the software for non -work purposes (37%)''

impact on hours per week:
* largest positive: personal sense of creativity; like the team; caring about reputation in the foss community
* negative impact: if a person works on multiple projects at the same time (logical, they have less time per project Oo), formal it training (warum auch immer, wird nicht weiter analysiert)

survey design/overview
* conducted 2001-2002 (vlt auch spannend zu vergleichen, von wann die Daten sind)
* selection of contributors to projects on sourceforge; invited to participate
* demography: nearly all male, Western Europe/North America, average 30 years old, majority professional developers and formal IT training(but not all of them work on foss for their job); ~19% students
* 684 responses total
* ~40% paid to do FOSS

Kritik
* gramatikalische und so Fehler
* unlogische Schlussfolgerungen (siehe unten)
* omitting data (in the clustering analysis, some motives with higher percentages are not cited)
* ``A detailed examination of the difference in project types between those that stated work-related needs and
nonwork -related needs showed that there was no technical difference between them.''
--> Ich finds äußerst merkwürdig dass hier ein Unterschied erwartet wurde
* ``A majority of the projects that
were indicated as nonwork were of sufficient technical scope and applicability that firms also produced similar
proprietary versions. We therefore see a blurring of distinction in the software produced for work and nonwork
purposes.''
--> Die Schlussfolgerung find ich auch bescheuert; bloß weil es Firmen gibt, die proprietäre Software schreiben, für die es FOSS Alternativen gibt, heißt es nicht dass der Bedarf für diese Software job-related ist
--> Ich kann es nachvollziehen, dass die Unterscheidung zwischen Software geschrieben für work and non work puproses schwammig ist, ist ja naheliegend;
Jedoch hat das wohl kaum damit zu tun, dass non-work related projects technisch genau anspruchsvoll sind.
Ist auch nicht eine Konsequenz daraus dass es FOSS und proprietäre Software gibt, die das selbe tun.
* ``Furthermore, contrary to experimental findings on the negative impact of extrinsic
rewards on intrinsic motivations (Deci, Koestner, and Ryan 1999) , we find that being paid and
feeling creative on F/OSS projects does not have a significant negative impact on project effort.''
--> Warum sollte being creative eine negative Auswirkung auf die Stunden, die man investiert haben? Ich dachte, eher "being paid" hat ne negative Auswirkung auf die Kreativität.. und evtl auf das Endergebnis, aber das ist nicht was dieser Satz da sagt..
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ZhoMoc2012]

Question: What makes Long Term Contributors to OSS?

Basiert auf Auswertung von Repository Data für Mozilla und Gnome

Motivation nicht explizit erwähnt, Sachen können evtl indirekt abgeleitet werden:
* gutes Arbeitsklima, mit Feedback, Interaktion mit den anderen Beteiligten am Projekt, auch Mentoring (related to feedback)
``The micro-climate with a productive and clustered peer group increases the odds.''
``crucial to gain people’s support.''
* wenn man schnell am Anfang dazu kommt, Issues zu fixen oder produktiv beizutragen --> Erfolgserlebnisse als Motivation
``Joiners who start by commenting on instead of reporting an issue or ones who succeed to get
at least one reported issue to be fixed, more than double their odds of becoming an LTC.''


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[LerTir2002]

``To an economist, the behavior of individual programmers and commercial
companies engaged in open source projects is initially startling.''
-_- I'd rather say "to a capitalist, the behavior is initially startling.."

* altruism, giving back to the public
``The idea that the proprietary software social system -- the system
that says you are not allowed to share or change software -- is
unsocial, that it is unethical, that it is simply wrong may come as a
surprise to some people. But what else can we say about a system
based on dividing the public and keeping users helpless? [Stallman,
1999]''
* ego/reputation boost; personal satisfaction
``The `utility function' Linux hackers is maximizing is not classically
economic, but is the intangible of their own ego satisfaction and
reputation among other hackers. [Raymond, 1999b].''

But as true economists seek explainations behind altruism^^

also nicht nur "arme Menschen" (was auch immer damit gemeint ist), profitieren vom FOSS
``While users in
less developed countries undoubtedly bene¢t from access to free software,''

* developing software to satisfy personal needs
``The open source development process is somewhat reminiscent of the type of `user-
driven innovation' seen in many other industries.''
``In many instances,
solutions developed by particular users for individual problems have
become more general solutions for wide classes of users.''

* (related): contribute to existing FOSS project, which they use for a project for work (their job); so they are technically paid
(and they can do bug fixing and customizing on the project, because its foss on the 1st place)
``First, the programmer, when fixing a bug or customizing an open source program, may actually
improve rather than reduce her performance in the mission endowed upon
her by her employer. This is particularly relevant for system administra-
tors looking for specific solutions for their company.''
``Meanwhile, many of the new
contributors are already employed by corporations, and working on
Apache development as part of their regular assignments.''

* enjoyable to experiment with new stuff:
``Second, the programmer compares how enjoyable the mission set by the employer and the
open source alternative are. A `cool' open source project may be more
fun than a routine task.''

* possible future job offers: ``career concern incentive''
(because of recognized skill of the programmer, since the code is open)

* peer recognition : ``ego gratification incentive''

* learning soft-skills (e.g. team communication)

===========================================================================

Freifunk Motivation
===================
[Mabb2014]
* Experimentieren mit Technik, Lernen --> freie Bildung
* eine soziale Idee --> almende/commons/gemeinschaftliche Verwaltete Ressource
* Netzneutralität: ``Netzzugang ist ein Menschenrecht. Freie Netzwerke bieten allen Menschen
neutralen Zugang offen an und entstehen, indem jede und jeder einen Teil beiträgt.''


[WNDW2013]
* affordable; in manchen Fällen und Regionen die einzige Option, um an Internet dran zu kommen
``Using inexpensive off-the-shelf equipment, you can build high speed data
networks that connect remote areas together, provide broadband network
access in areas where even dialup does not exist, and ultimately connect
you and your neighbours to the global Internet.''
``There are many rural parts all over the globe that remain unconnected to
the Internet for reasons of cost, geography, politics and so on.''
