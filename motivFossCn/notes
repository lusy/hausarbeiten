FOSS Motivation
===============

[HarOu02]

2 broad categories:
* internal factors (e.g. intrinsic motivation, altruism)
* external rewards (e.g. expected future returns, personal needs)

general asumption:
``Typically,
open-source software is developed by an Internet-based community of pro-
grammers. Participation is voluntary, and participants do not receive direct
compensation for their work.''
(but is it still the case? article was published 2002 nevertheless..)

``In addition, the entire source code is made
available to the public. The developers devolve most of the property rights
to the public, including the right to use, redistribute, and modify the soft-
ware free of charge.''
--> can we derive motivations here for?

``Its pro-
ponents regard it as a paradigmatic change whereby the economics of private
goods, built on the scarcity of resources, is replaced by the economics of pub-
lic goods, where scarcity is not an issue.''
--> advocating for a new economy model? smash capitalism^^?

--> there is a questionaire at the end of the paper

Motivation in general
* ``Maslow
identified five needs that drive human activities, ranging from physiological
needs to the need for self-actualization [16].''
* Deci: intrinsic motivation (``desire to feel competent and self-determined.'')<-->  external factors (``direct or indirect monetary compensation, and
recognition by others.'') [6]
* ``Herzberg, who views motivation as a func-
tion of three factors: ability of the individual over potential, ability over ability,
and reinforcement behavior [11]''
* Klandermans: ``distinguishes social motivations, collective motivations,
and reward motivations [14].''
* Maslow: self-actualization needs (intrinsic) and esteem needs:“desire for a stable, firmly
based, usually high evaluation of [oneself]” [16, p. 21]. (desires for recognition, fame, and reputation -> external)


Internal factors
* ``feelings of competence, satisfaction, and fulfillment that arise from writing programs.''
* altruism: ``“doing something for another at some cost to oneself” [18, p. 5].
Since open-source programmers provide something for others (writing pro-
grams with open-source code) at their own expense (time, energy, opportu-
nity costs, etc.), they belong to this category''
* community identification: ``It corresponds to Maslow’s needs for belonging and love.''
  ** align their goals with those of the community.
  ** teach other members of the community “kin-selection altruism”

External Rewards

Future Rewards
* ``may obtain indirect rewards by increasing their
marketability and skill base or by selling related products and services.''
* view their participation as future investment
* Revenues from Related Products and Services: e.g. commercial consulting, training, distribution, support,
and implementation services
--> boundaries sometimes fuzzy
--> sometimes competening needs: improving the software declines the need for support
* Human Capital: expanding the personal skill base -> leads to ``better job opportunities, higher
salaries, and more fulfilling jobs''
  ** open source code allows to choose project according to the skills one wants to improve
  ** allow entry level programmers to participate in real projects (<-- das würde ich fast hinterfragen^^)
* Self-Marketing: ``effective way to demonstrate their capabilities and skills''
  ** ``good advertising channel for those seeking to advance in the programming field.'' <-- die Lebenslaufkategorie
* Peer Recognition
  ** feedback (also learning): ``open-source programmers receive rapid, constructive feedback about the quality of their work.''
  ** recognition, someone is using the software

Personal Needs
* developers program a software they personally need (historical examples: Perl, Apache Web Server)

Free vs Commercial Software
``The more complex a product is, and the less dependent on other software modules [...] the more likely
that programmers will sell their software''

Results of the empirical survey
-------------------------
* 79 reponses
* 95% male
* 1/4 without college education
* 1/2 working as programmers
* 16% paid directly for developing open source
* >1/2 participate in more than 1 project
* 85% 20-40 years
* 16% rated high on altruism
* 30% identify strongly with the open-source community/have kinlike relationships with open source programmers
* 14% (want to) sell related products or services
* 50% wanted to improve their programming skills
* several wanted to improve other skills: ``learn english and teamwork''
* several do it because it ``demonstrates my abilities'' or ``I can use it as a reference''
* 52% "because I build a network of peers"
* ``hope to gain positive reputation''
* ``develop tools I need to do my job''/''need the...''

* ``Hobbyists and students were the most internally motivated''
* ``Students and hobby programmers seemed to be more strongly motivated by altruism and community identification.''
* ``Salaried and contract programmers, in contrast, hoped to sell related products and services.''
* ``Surprisingly, for this group determination and peer recognition needs correlated negatively with level of effort.''
* developers paid for open source: ``most concerned with self-marketing and
fulfilling their personal software needs''

Freifunk Motivation
===================
[Mabb14]
* Experimentieren mit Technik, Lernen --> freie Bildung
* eine soziale Idee --> almende/commons/gemeinschaftliche Verwaltete Ressource
* Netzneutralität: ``Netzzugang ist ein Menschenrecht. Freie Netzwerke bieten allen Menschen
neutralen Zugang offen an und entstehen, indem jede und jeder einen Teil beiträgt.''
