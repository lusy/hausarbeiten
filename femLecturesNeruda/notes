[Kolodny1980]

"What was at stake was not so much literature
or criticism as such, but the historical, social, and ethical conse-
quences of women's participation in, or exclusion from, either
enterprise"
-> use in conclusion?

"Kennard appropriately cau-
tions us against drawing from her work any simplistically reductive
thesis about the mimetic relations between art and life. Yet her
approach nonetheless suggests that what is important about a fic-
tion is not whether it ends in a death or a marriage, but what the
symbolic demands of that particular conventional ending imply
about the values and beliefs of the world that engendered it"
--> can be used as an argument in the analysis itself?

"The power relations inscribed in the form of conven-
tions within our literary inheritance, these critics argue, reify the
encodings of those same power relations in the culture at large."
--> what is written about adorns the subjects with importance, not the other way round, vgl auch "Little Women"

"these critics also insist upon exam-
ining not only the mirroring of life in art, but also the normative
impact of art on life."

über die Ordnungs-Funktion des Kanons:
""The way art helps
people to order, interpret, mythologize, or dispose of their own
experience," she declares, may be "complex and often ambiguous,
but it is not impossible to define.""
(citing Robinson)

"For what we are
asking be scrutinized are nothing less than shared cultural assump-
tions so deeply rooted and so long ingrained that, for the most
part, our critical colleagues have ceased to recognize them as such."
-> weswegen Nerudas Liebesgedichte als "universell" gelesen werden


"That is, that
the fact of canonization puts any work beyond questions of estab-
lishing its merit and, instead, invites students to offer only increas-
ingly more ingenious readings and interpretations, the purpose of
which is to validate the greatness already imputed by canonization."
--> also sind Readings von Sachen im Kanon meist auch noch langweilig, weil sie nur nochmal beteuern wie toll das Werk ist

"The very fact
of our critical training within the strictures imposed by an estab-
lished canon of major works and authors, however, repeatedly
deflects us from such questions. Instead, we find ourselves end-
lessly responding to the riposte that the overwhelmingly male
presence among canonical authors was only an accident of history-
and never intentionally sexist-coupled with claims to the "obvious"
aesthetic merit of those canonized texts."

"an established canon functions as a
model by which to chart the continuities and discontinuities, as
well as the influences upon and the interconnections between
works, genres, and authors. That model we tend to forget, how-
ever, is of our own making."
-> Weitere Kritik am Kanon: Es ist ein Model; und alle Modelle sind Vereinfachungen -> sie setzen Fokus auf bestimmte Features und verdecken/ignorieren andere;
-> Mit dieser Aussage als Kanon-Definition starten und dann infrage stellen wie er zustande kommt.
-> Je nachdem welche Werte und welche Prinzipien zur Model-Bildung wir ins Zentrum stellen, entstehen dabei verschiedene Modelle (also kann ein ganz anderer Kanon zustande kommen)

"the conclusion
that we appropriate meaning from a text according to what we
need (or desire) or, in other words, according to the critical assump-
tions or predispositions (conscious or not) that we bring to it. And
we appropriate different meanings, or report different gleanings, at
different times-even from the same text-according to our changed
assumptions, circumstances, and requirements."
-> Je nachdem wer zu welcher Zeit ein Werk liest, entdeckt die Person dadrin verschiedene Sachen.
In fact, wenn wir Sachen wiederholt lesen, lesen wir auch jedes Mal beim selben Werk neue Sachen rein, je nachdem was wir für Erfahrungen gesammelt haben in der Zwischenzeit, welche Fragen uns in dem Moment primär beschäftigen, etc.

"What makes it so exciting, of course, is
that it can be constantly releamed and refined, so as to provide
either an individual or an entire reading community, over time,
with infinite variations of the same text. It can provide that, but,
I must add, too often it does not"
Quote Komilitonin mit: "universell menschliches fleischliches Begehren" -> und argue that we need critical feminist thinking education in order to shift perspectives in such readings.
Fast der ganze Kurs mit Ausnahme der Professorin und ein paar Studentinnen, die über das Durschnittsalter von 22 waren, scheinten mit der Leseweise kein Problem zu haben.
Ich frage mich was die selbe Person heute darüber sagen würde, wenn sie die Gedichte nochmal liest.

"what we are taught to read well and with pleasure,
when we are young, predisposes us to certain specific kinds of
adult reading tastes."
"The delight we learn to take in the mastery
of these interpretive strategies is then often mistakenly construed
as our delight in reading specific texts, especially in the case of
works that would otherwise be unavailable or even offensive to
us."
-> delight from successfully applying established paradigms
(vgl me and poetry)

", I have been
able to enter that text through interpretive strategies which allow
me to displace less comfortable observations with others to which
I have been taught pleasurably to attend"

"For, simply
put, we read well, and with pleasure, what we already know how
to read; and what we know how to read is to a large extent depend-
ent upon what we have already read (works from which we've
developed our expectations and learned our interpretive strategies).
What we then choose to read-and, by extension, teach and there-
by "canonize"-usually follows upon our previous reading. Radical
breaks are tiring, demanding, uncomfortable, and sometimes wholly
beyond our comprehension."

"we must re-
examine not only our aesthetics but, as well, the inherent biases
and assumptions informing the critical methods which (in part)
shape our aesthetic responses."

Feministische Kritik stellt uns folgende Fragen:
- how are aesthetic values assigned
- do they reside with the reader or the text?
- what ends do the judgements serve?
- what value systems do they help perpetuate?


"What unites and repeatedly invigorates feminist literary criti-
cism, then, is neither dogma nor method but, as I have indicated
earlier, an acute and impassioned attentiveness to the ways in
which primarily male structures of power are inscribed (or en-
coded) within our literary inheritance; the consequences of that
encoding for women-as characters, as readers, and as writers;
and, with that, a shared analytic concern for the implications of
that encoding not only for a better understanding of the past, but
also for an improved reordering of the present and future as well."
