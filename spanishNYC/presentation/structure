                           how long have lived in the US, residential patterns, intergroup communication
-> bilingualism: 63% census respondents (2007) who speak Spanish at home also report that they speak English well or very well
-> shift to English after 2nd generation Spanish
-> die Spanisch-sprachige Community beruht auf neue Migrationen
-> linguistic insecurity:
  * def:
  * all Spanish speakers in front of English (dominant language)
  * higher for Caribbean (speak more "radical varieties")

More detailed stuff (not sure whether to put it above or bellow)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-> race: most afrodescendientes among Dominicans (and Puerto Ricans): language has lower prestige
-> Colombians (and other South and Central Americans) - highest labor force participation rate
-> Cubans have most education, highest income
-> Puerto Ricans are the largest group (U.S. citizens, first to arrive in large numbers)
-> but most disadvantaged: lowest labor force participation rate, lowest income, least education
