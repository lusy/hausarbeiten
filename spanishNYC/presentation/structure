Intro
-------------------
* Spanish in NYC heute
* Welche Prozesse finden statt
Fragestellung von [Zentella90] anpassen?
"we sought to investigate whether each group maintained its country's regional lexicon,
assimilated that of the largest Spanish speaking group in the city or the most prestigious variety,
or produced another, «New Yorker Spanish» lexicon"
-> also nicht nur auf lexicon, sondern auch auf anderen sprachlichen Merkmalen? (welche Beispiele zeige ich?)

* Quellen! /Welche Sprecherinnengruppen werden in den Quellen untersucht
-> Otheguy-Zentella Corpus 2007? : "Puerto  Ricans, Dominicans, Mexicans, Ecuadorians,  Colombians, and  Cubans"
-> earlier works "Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Colombians, and Cubans"

-----------------------------------
Background/aktuelle Situation
---------------------

-> 2007 Census 28% population NYC is hispanic (no undocumented people!)
-> Tabelle: Demographics NYC (nyc department of city planning: Top10 foreign born; PR not included->US citizens!)
-> According to the 2006-2007 Center for Latin American, Caribbean & Latino Studies:[50]
  Puerto Rican: (778,628)
  Dominican: (602,093)
  Mexican: (289,755)
  Ecuadorian: (201,708)
  Colombian: (113,469)
  Salvadoran:(100,396)
  Other Hispanic or Latino: (351,635)
(source: wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City, Originellquellen waren angegeben, aber Dokumente nicht mehr erreichbar)

-> Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Colombians, and Cubans arrived in the city at different periods and under different circumstances.[Zentella90]
-> wichtige soz. Faktoren: race, class (income), education, (gender),
                           how long have lived in the US, residential patterns, social networks, intergroup communication
                           (vlt gleich hier erwähnen was sie für Tendenzen aufweisen?)
-> bilingualism: 63% census respondents (2007) who speak Spanish at home also report that they speak English well or very well
-> shift to English after 2nd generation Spanish
-> die Spanisch-sprachige Community beruht auf neue Migrationen
-> Latin@s do want bilingualism for their children (survey, [Zentella97]), but multiple factors impede this.
-> nicht alle Varietäten sind gleich: "radical" Caribbean Spanish has lower prestige than "conservative" Mainland Spanish (nearer to the Castilian norm)
-> "'Incorrect' aspects of grammar or pronunciation label their speakers as inferior" [Zentella07]
   sowohl bei Spanisch-Muttersprachlerinnen, die Englisch sprechen, als auch bei Caribbean Spanish
-> linguistic intolerance: eine Sprachpolitik, die sehr aufs Erhalten des Englischen (das gar nicht gefährdet ist) konzentriert ist;
   und Sprecherinnen anderer Sprachen ziemlich krass diskriminiert
-> bilinguals discriminated from both sides: viewed as "linguistically deficient and cognitively confused"[Zentella07]
   * mocked for imperfect English, sign of unwillingness to integrate
   * denied their Latino identity if they give up their local variant
-> linguistic insecurity: (promoted by last 2)
  * def: "consider their dialect inferior to others"[Zentella07]
  * all Spanish speakers in front of English (dominant language)
  * higher for Caribbean (speak more "radical varieties")
    Dominicans selber: "80% believe that their Spanish should not be taught in schools, 35% of these because it is «incorrecto» or «malo»" [Zentella90]

Mögliche Erwartungen
-> speakers adopt more prestigious languages/variants (English/"conservative" Spanish variants - "la norma culta")
-> speakers adopt the variant of the biggest group (PR/Caribbean in general)
-> speakers adopt a variant of a feature that is common for the most dialects

----------------------------------------------------------------
More detailed stuff (not sure whether to put it above or bellow)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Soziale Faktoren
----------------
Related to language prestige
-> race: most afrodescendientes among Dominicans (and Puerto Ricans): language has lower prestige
  "race has been remapped from biology onto language"[Zentella07]
  "widespread rejection of Dominican Spanish" [Zentella90]
-> class: Colombians (and other South and Central Americans) - highest labor force participation rate
-> class: Cubans have most education, highest income
-> Größe: Puerto Ricans are the largest group (U.S. citizens, first to arrive in large numbers)
-> class: but most disadvantaged: lowest labor force participation rate, lowest income, least education (class)
-> "Although overt norms favor standard speech, powerful covert norms encourage
    group members to remain faithful to group codes, linguistic and otherwise." [Zentella07]
    ** Dominicans keep their low prestige variant, because "overcorrectness" is associated with "feminine"

-> Puerto Rican variant is less prestigious, nevertheless migrants often try to pass for PRs, since they're US citizens
-> style/Sozioindexikalität: adopt linguistic forms of groups one sympathises with/has intense relationships with

Others
------
-> avoiding misunderstandings : try to pick neutral terms when talking to out-group members
-> Medien(Zeitung, Radio, Fernsehen) spielen auch eine Rolle: überregionale/konservative Varietäten / English

Lexical
-------

* majority unity:
cadena «chain necklace»: Cu 95%, PR 91%, DR 83%, Col 75%
* lone exception:
orange = naranja: (PR china 65/63, + All-Col)
mattress = colchón: (PR matre 64/77, + All)
desk = escritorio: (Cu buró 74/94, +one Col)
bus = guagua: (Col bus 81/76, + All)
* two for/two against:
18. banana = guineo:
(PR 67/59, DR 86/40, + Col)
(Cu plátano 75/48, + All)
(Col banano 63/80)
19. eyeglasses = espejuelos:
(PR 50/54, Cu 91/16, + All)
(Col gafas 49/57, + All)
(DR lentes 45/47, + All)
-> no clear regional pattern to the groupings [Zentella90](wichtig im Vergleich zu Pronomen, wo es angeblich eins gibt..)

Die von der größten Sprecherinnengruppe? "The continued existence of both leading competitors for #s 21 and 22 is favored by the fact that the largest
group, Puerto Ricans, used both of them at similar rates: puerco (36%) and cerdo (37%), bodega (37%) and tienda (42%)."[Zentella90]

Low prestige of Dominican variant:
Dominicans did not produce any word that was favored by a majority of their
group only, but speakers from that country produced the most examples of words which the others did
not mention at all.[...] The majority of Dominicans did offer other more widely known words as
their everyday terms for these items. [Zentella90]

homonyme:
"wawa" - Bus in PR, wild animal in Colombia
En la huelga de los trenes y me dice «Vamos a coger la wawa.» Y yo, yo la seguía pero yo no sabía.
¿La wawa? No, porque para no'tros es un animal. Y entonces yo le 'ij' «Pero mira que allí viene el bus
[Spanish] que me que pasa por mi casa.» Y dijo, «Sí, sí, en ese nos vamos.» «¿Pero no'ijiste que ibas a
coger la wawa?» Y entonces ya ella me explicó.[Zentella90]

* Borrowings from English
-> prestige (natürlich)
-> Most items reflect a cultural reality that is new or different:
  [ŷins/bluŷines] "(blue)jeans"
  [la boila] "boiler" [Zentella97]
-> facilitated or even triggered by a similarity in the phonological and/or morphological structure of a word
  "librería" (Buchladen) für Bibliothek (library)
-> reduction in the number of syllables, e.g., [beis] replaces florero for «vase»
-> Anglicisms can play the role of neutralizer between competing dialectal variants because the
 prestigious outside language acts as the lingua franca that resolves the conflict without favoring one
 group at the expense of the other.
-> "but it seems that the longer a group has been in the U.S., the less they use the homeland's term"

calques:
"perder peso" instead of "rebajar" for "to lose weight"
"llamar para atrás" for "call back"

Grammatical
---------------
Subject Personal Pronouns

Overt vs Null Pronouns
----------------------
-> Spanish is a null-subject language
  "Viene"
  "Ella viene"
  both overt and null pronouns are accepted

-> Generell auf Spanisch: tendency for frontloading of personal pronouns in turns and utterances (till now no variants variation)
"the tendency  we  have  already discussed for the pronoun to  be
present when  a participant is  first mentioned and for it  to  be  absent  in  subsequent
references  to  the same  person  appears as  a straightforwardly motivated phenomenon" [OtheguyZentella12]

1a. [Question is  whether baseball  players in  the U.S deserve to  make  such  high
salaries.]  Yo  creo  que ellos son buenos. Aunque  yo  no  sé  mucho de  deporte pero
cuando  los veo por la  televisión, parecen ser buenos  ... porque  como  que ellos han
estudiado tanto y son campeones,  creo  que sí  se  lo  merecen [003U].
‘I  think that  they  are good. Although  I don’t know  much  about sports  but when  [I]
see them  on  TV, [they]  seem  good  ... because they  have  studied so  much  and
[they]  are champions,  [I] think that  [they]  do  deserve it.’

Erläuterungen:
For example,  in  the actual  usage in  1a, the speaker first
refers  to  the baseball  players using a pronoun (ellos  son buenos, “they are good”)  and
then  uses  a verb  without a pronoun for the next  mention (parecen  ser buenos, “[they]
seem  to  be  good”). This  pattern is  repeated  in  the next  sentence, by  using a pronoun for
the first mention of  the players (ellos  han estudiado,  “they have  studied”) and then
omitting  it  for the next  two mentions  (son  campeones and se  lo  merecen,  “[they] are
champions and [they]  deserve it”).[OtheguyZentella12]
"This tendency
toward  front-loading the occurrence  of  pronouns  in  turns and utterances, and to  first
using the pronoun and then  leaving it  out,  is  strong  in  Spanish,"[OtheguyZentella12]


-> Caribbean variants use more pronouns than mainland
"Notice,  in  2a, the consistent  use of  subject personal  pronouns  by  the Dominican
Of  the nineteen  eligible  verbs in  this  Caribbean passage,  eight have  a pronoun (a  42
percent rate  for this  passage). In  contrast, the Ecuadorian  in  2b  makes spare use of
pronouns; of  the eleven  eligible  verbs in  2b, only  two have  a pronoun (an 18  percent rate
for this  passage)."

2a. [Incidents  when  learning  to  milk  cows].  Cuando  yo  aprendí.  Con doce  años  y
me  mandaban  a ordeñar una cantidad  de  vacas por la  mañana. De  cuando
regresábamos  para  atrás—y una vez nosotros  nos fuimos  a ordeñar mi  hermano y
yo  ... Cuando  fuimos  y odeñamos  siete vacas,  venimos,  cuando  veníamos  tenía tres
días  lloviendo y estaba  muy resbaloso y yo  resbalé que venía con,  con una lata  de
leche como  con quince  o dieciséis litros  de  leche,  y resbalé y se  botaron todos,  y
nosotros, “Ay,  y ¿cómo nosotros  vamos a llegar  a la  casa?”  que “Hoy  me  mata  mi
mamá,”  y “Ay,  ¿cómo lo  vamos a hacer?” Cuando  llegamos, nosotros  le  dijimos a mi
mamá  lo  que había pasado  y ella  no  nos lo  creía y entonces  mi  papá  dijo, “Pero que
esos  muchachitos no  se  podían  mandar  hoy a ordeñar hoy,  ¿Por  qué no  me
llamaste  para  ir  yo  o fuiste  tú, eso fue que tú  sabes como  es  que está  el  día y eso,
hoy no  estaba  de  esos  muchachitos ir  a ordeñar.” [125D]
‘When I learned.  At  age 12, and [they]  sent  me  to  milk  a lot of  cows  in  the morning.
When  [we]  got back—and  once  we  went  to  milk  my  brother and I ... When  [we]
went  and [we]  milked  seven cows, [we]  came, when  [we]  came  it  had been  raining
for three days  and it  was very  slippery  and I slipped that  [I] was coming  with, with
a can of  milk  like  with  fifteen or  sixteen liters  of  milk, and [I] slipped and everything
spilled and we, “Oh,  How are we  going to  go  home?”  that  “Today  my  mother  will  kill
me,”  and “Oh,  what  are [we]  going to  do.”  When  [we]  arrived,  we  told  our mother
what  had happened  and she did not believe us  and then  my  father  said, “But  those
kids  should  not have  been  sent  to  milk  today.  Why didn’t  [you] call  me  for me  to  go,
or  why didn’t  you go? That's  because you know  what  the weather is  like  today and
it  was not for those children  to  go  milking today.” ’

  2b. [Interviewer  asks  about whether there is  a social  life  at  school].  No, ¿a  qué
  hora? No. Voy,  o sea,  llego del trabajo y me  voy a la  universidad,  y es, es
  diferente,  no  es  como  antes (p.75)   que  uno iba y habían  amigos  ahí,  y ..  y se  veían
  entre el  día,  es  diferente,  todos son adultos,  todos tienen  su  vida  y es, uno entra,
  oye la  clase,  las notas,  lo  que sea,  okay, chao  y nos vamos,  o sea,  no  es, no  es  que,
  “Okay,  llámame o ... o te  veo más tarde”, o “te veo en  otra  clase”, sino  que es . . es
  muy diferente.  [326E]
  ‘No,  at  what  time? [I] go, that  is  [I] arrive  from  work  and [I] go  to  the university,
  and it's  different,  it's  not like  before  that  one would go  and there were  friends
  there and ... and [they]  saw each  other during  the day,  [they]  are all adults, all
  have  their life  and it's, one goes  in, listens to  the class,  the notes,  whatever, ok,
  bye,  and [we]  leave,  that  is, it's  not,  “Ok,  call  me” or  ... “[I]  will  see you later”, or
  “[I]  will  see you in  another class,” but rather  it's . . it's very  different. ’

Possible conclusions:
-> Caribbean variants have more pronouns, because considered less prestigious, thus greater convergence towards English (pronouns are obligatory)
-> Caribbean variants have more pronouns, because speakers have lived longer in the US (however Spanish loss after 2 generations)
-> Caribbean variants have more pronouns, because of phonological features (e.g. final s deletion, which makes it difficult to understand the semantics without pronouns)
-> Tendency: Consistent with  a dialectal leveling
hypothesis, the differences in  pronoun rates between newcomers from  the Caribbean
and newcomers from  the Mainland  have  narrowed  among Caribbeans  and Mainlanders
of  the second  generation. [OtheguyZentella12]
-> Bilinguals/speakers more proficient in English use more pronouns than newcomers: bestätigt die English Influnece Hypothese [OtheguyZentella12]

Preplacement of overt personal pronouns vs postplacement [RanaRisso10]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* "This alterntion between preposed and postposed overt subject pronouns is found in all varieties of Spanish,
and it is very likely that it responds to linguistic-internal and speaker-external conditioning variables."[RanaRisso10]
* "..in Spanish overwhelming majority of subject pronouns are preposed to the verb, there are several specific linguistic environments where,
according to the research literature, postposition is preferred."
  -> interrogative pronoun introducing a question
  -> intransitive verb
  -> sentence includes a relative clause

* "It has also been claimed that there are dialectal differences in pronoun placement between the Caribbean and the Latin American Mainland."[RanaRisso10]

"..in the Caribbean, overt pronominal subjects may be preposed in subordinate clauses with non-finite verbs as in 2),
while other varieties of Spanish require postposition, as in 3)" [RanaRisso10]
  2) Dejé     ver     la cicatriz para yo (underlined) saber (bold)  cómo es eso
    Allowed-I to show the scar    for  I (underlined) to know (bold) how that is
    'I allowed the scar to show, for me to know how it looks like'

  3) El decir(bold)lo    tú(underline)   y    entender(bold)lo       yo(underline) ...
     For to say(bold)-it you (unterline) and  to understand(bold)-it I(underline)
     'For you to say it and for me to understand it...'

direct questions that start with an interrogative pronoun -> "traditionally, authors have noted that postposition is required in such interrogatives."
-> in the Caribbean preposition is favored:

4) ¿Qué tú(underline)  quieres(bold)?
   What you(underline) want(bold)?
   'What do you want?'

5) ¿Cómo tú te llamas?
instead of
¿Cómo te llamas tú?

 Hypothesis:
->"dialectal differences in the speech of newcomers to the City from Latin America
(more preposing in the speech of Caribbeans than in that of Mainlanders)"
-> "I also expect that as these newcomers are exposed to speakers from other parts of Latin America,
these initial dialectal differences will, with the passing of time, be leveled out."
-> "I expect that, with the passage of time spent in New York, as Spanish-speakers become more and more exposed to English,
patterns of English usage will affect their Spanish, leading to an increase not only in the occurrence rate of overt pronouns
but also in that of preposed pronouns." [RanaRisso10]

Studie:
* dependent variable: use of preposed pronouns
* independent variables: overall rate of overt pronouns use; region of origin; exposure group (NY raised, newcomers, immigrants)

"Caribbean Spanish allows preposed pronouns where other dialects of Spanish have a null or a posposed subject" [RanaRisso10]
"Caribbeans use more overt pronouns than Mailanders and they prepose their overts more than Mainlanders." [RanaRisso10]
"Caribbean Spanish behaves more like English and less like Mainland Spanish."

Befunde:
"second-generation participants (NYR) have higher rates of preposed pronouns than first-generation ones...
and that there is also an increase within the first generation, immigrants showing a higher preposed rate than newcomers."
"the more years of their lives the speakers spend in NY, the higher the rate of preposed pronouns"
