\section{Feministische Lektüren}

In diesem Kapitel werden wir kurz die Werkzeuge erläutern, die für die anschließende Diskussion einer Auswahl der Nerudas Liebesgedichte benutzt werden sollten.

\subsection{Pluralität der Lektüren}

% an sich feministisch, diese zu erlauben und nicht für DIE (einzig) richtige Lektüre eines Textes zu argumentieren

[Beehler1988]
"Consequently, what we teach in the English class-
room is not "literature" but ways of reading. By
helping students to identify different methods,
different positions from which to view a work, we
help them to realize that texts do not "reveal"
truth: they simply provide the field upon which
meanings can be produced."

\subsection{Close Reading}

%Was steht wirklich da?
Eins der Werkzeuge, die wir benutzen werden, um uns Nerudas Liebeslyrik zu erschließen, ist das Close Reading.
Zunächst von XY geprägt, handelt es sich dabei um das Konzept, den Text für sich selber zu betrachten, gezielt zu lesen was wirklich da steht.

  9. Closing in On Close Reading - Nancy Boyles
  "Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover layers of meaning that lead to deep comprehension." (p.90)

  [Gallop2007]
"When the New Critics introduced the methodology called close reading
in the years just before and after World War II, what it replaced was liter
ary history (the old historicism, we might call it)."

"I would argue that the most valuable thing English ever had to offer was
the very thing that made us a discipline, that transformed us from cultured
gentlemen into a profession: close reading. Not because it is necessarily the
best way to read literature but because it, learned through practice with lit
erary texts, learned in literature classes, is a widely applicable skill, of value
not just to scholars in other disciplines but to a wide range of students
with many different futures. Students trained in close reading have been
known to apply it to diverse sorts of texts--newspaper articles, textbooks
in other disciplines, political speeches--and thus to discover things they
would not otherwise have noticed. This enhanced, intensified reading can
prove invaluable for many kinds of jobs as well as in their lives."

"For more than three decades, antielitist pedagogy has crystallized
around Paulo Freire's criticism of the banking model, in which the teacher
deposited knowledge in the student. This model remains dominant in
most academic disciplines where there is a huge gap between scholars
producing knowledge and classrooms where students receive, repeat, and
apply that knowledge. The literature classroom has represented a real
alternative to the banking model: students had to encounter the text di
rectly and produce their own knowledge; close reading meant they could
not just apply knowledge produced elsewhere, not just parrot back what
the teacher or textbook had told them"

 When you close read, you observe facts and details about the text. You may focus on a particular passage, or on the text as a whole. Your aim may be to notice all striking features of the text, including rhetorical features, structural elements, cultural references; or, your aim may be to notice only selected features of the text—for instance, oppositions and correspondences, or particular historical references.

 The second step is interpreting your observations. What we're basically talking about here is inductive reasoning: moving from the observation of particular facts and details to a conclusion, or interpretation, based on those observations. And, as with inductive reasoning, close reading requires careful gathering of data (your observations) and careful thinking about what these data add up to.

Every word, every line, must be considered and reconsidered, as well as their place in the whole structure

The Close Reading of Poetry
A Practical Introduction and Guide to Explication
 Posted on March 2, 2012
 © G. Kim Blank & Magdalena Kay < > English Department, University of Victoria

There is no single way to do a close reading of a poem. Sometimes an impression is a way in; sometimes the “voice” in the poem stands out; sometimes it is a matter of knowing the genre of the poem; sometimes groupings of key words, phrases, or images seem to be its most striking elements; and sometimes it takes a while to get any impression whatsoever. The goal, however, is constant: you want to come to a deeper understanding of the poem. T

\subsection{Die Rolle des Kanons}

\begin{comment}
   * Kanon
    ** Was einmal im Kanon ist, ist halt im Kanon, und das "ästhetische" Wert wird nicht hinterfragt (vgl Annette Kolodny;  wir sollten uns dringendst fragen sollten, wie der Kanon zustande gekommen ist, wer das bestimmt und was drin ist und warum)
    ** wir lesen gerne und gut, das was wir gelernt haben zu lesen
    ** Annette Kolodny: "we appropriate meaning from a text according to what we need (or desire) or, in other words, according to the critical assumptions or predispositions (conscious or not) that we bring to it. And we appropriate different meanings, or report different gleanings, at different times-even from the same text-according to our changed assumptions, circumstances, and requirements."
    ** Annette Kolodny: "It can provide that, but, I must add, too often it does not. Frequently our reading habits become fixed"

\subsection{Lektüre im historischen Kontext}
\begin{comment}

  % Wieder in Kontext integrieren; Close Reading ist schön, aber wir laufen Gefahr, Werke zu kanonisieren und (Bedeutungs-)Schichten zu vergessen
  % Allerdings argumentiert die Frau, dass sie genau um dieser "timeless" Kanonisierung entgegenzuwirken, sich für Close Reading einsetzt
  [Gallop2007]
  re and complained that de
  constructionist literary criticism as practiced in United States English
  departments was in fact all too much like the old New Criticism--elitist,
  canonical, and ahistorical.

  "It is precisely my opposition to timeless universals that makes
  me value close reading. I would argue that close reading poses an ongoing
  threat to easy, reductive generalization, that it is a method for resisting
  and calling into question our inevitable tendency to bring things together
  in smug, overarching conclusions. I would argue that close reading may in
  fact be the best antidote we have to the timeless and the universal."

3. Feministische Lektüren
   * Pluralität (vlt in die Intro vorziehen)
     Annette Kolodny: "In my view, our purpose is not and should not be the formulation of any single reading method or potentially procrustean set of critical procedures[...] Instead, as I se it, our task is to initiate nothing less than a playful pluralism, responsice to the possibilities of multiple critical schools and methods, but captive of none.."
