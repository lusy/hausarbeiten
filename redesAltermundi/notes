[Latour] ANT

-- ich weiß noch nicht wie hilfreich das ist, aber paar Gedanken/Kernzitate vom Text

"whenever you widh to define an entity (an agent, an actant, an acotr) you have to deploy its attributes, tat is, its network"
"the technology.. /digital technology .. makes networks material and explicit" (infrastruktur ist präsent und sichtbar im öffentlichen Raum) --> wem gehört die Infrastruktur? wer kontrolliert die? Wer hat (physischen) Zugang dazu?
"he expansion of digitality has
enormously increased the material dimension of networks: the more digital, the less
virtual and the more material a given activity becomes." <-- das ist das Exaktzitat

"In its simplest but also in its deepest sense, the notion of network is of use
whenever action is to be redistributed."

Eigenschaften eines Netzwerks:
* distribution
* visibility/Explizierung von dependencies

Think about modelling the case study through ANT: kind of a liquid zooming in and out
Kern der Theorie:
"any entity can be seized
either as an actor (a corpuscle) or as a network (a wave). It is in this complete
reversibility—an actor is nothing but a network, except that a network is nothing but
actors—that resides the main originality of this theory. Here again, network is the
concept that helps you redistribute and reallocate action."

"philosophers have been carried out by the verb to be and its
problem of identity and not by the verb to have and the range of its properties and
avidities. But the web is changing all of that and fast: “to have” (friends, relations,
profiles...) is quickly becoming a stronger definition of oneself than “to be."" --> Sachen kriegen Identität durch ihre Beziehung zu einander

"subversion it introduces in the notion of distance (the adjectives “close” and “far” are
made dependant on the presence of conduits, bridges, and hubs)," <-- physical network

"it dissolves entirely the individual versus society conundrum"

Generelle Kritik: "Since the information is here why not use it?" --> und spricht gar nicht ethical concerns an
