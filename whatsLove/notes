# Life Writing Project "What's love got to do with it"

## Idea
* Several characters who grapple with "love" in different senses/perspectives

## Outline (stand 16.09.2023)

Was ist die Aussage?
1) Stories zu Romantic Love sind scheiße
1.1) Weil eindimensional
* Vgl Laurie Penny: Das einzige erlaubte Story-Format für Mädchen
* Jo March "Love is the only thing a girl is fit for"
* Also from Little Women "And, if the main character is a girl, make sure she is married by the end of the story."
* Wird überall total unnötig reingestopft (vgl Book of Dust vol 2)
* Message dass eine Frau ohne romantische Beziehung als Frau gescheitert ist
  -> the feeling of not being enough
  -> Beziehung/Love wird mit (Selbst)wert von einer Person gleichgesetzt
  -> das erhöht den Druck/Erwartungen und macht das Eingehen einer Beziehung noch schwieriger
  -> "we accept the love we think we deserve"

Eva Illouz:"expectations regarding marriage were changing: the ability in both men and women to be amusing and entertaining was becoming more important than the husband's role as a provider and the wife's as a helpmate"
Daisy Jones: "I'm not a muse, I'm the somebody."

1.2) provide(syn!) unrealistic expectations of reality
* Relationships are messy and hard work und nicht das Erlösen von allen Leiden der Welt
* Put here the branch with "To be in love with the idea of being in love"
* soulmates/the two halves of an orange
* "They lived happily ever after": Marriage
    Eva Illouz:"[Women] were asserting themselves in the realm of work.
    More fundamentally, they were rejecting the institution of marriage as the only safeguard of their economic standing.
    Becoming less dependent financially, women were expecting from marriage emotional fulfillment rather than economic security." //viel Spaß damit

1.3) Verdecken strukturelle Probleme: Das Glück im Privaten soll für strukturelle Missstände Ausgleich bieten
Setting:
Eva Illouz: "withdrawal from public life has made social and public indentity collapse and relocate itself in the overheated sphere of private personal relationships."
and "we moderns have come to focus and concentrate on inner psychic life and on private and interpersonal, rather than formal and public, relationships."
* Kritik an Ehe als Institution (siehe auch letzten Punkt in 1.2, vlt entscheiden ob es insgesamt besser da oder hier reinpasst)

1.4) Befeuern Kapitalismus/Consumer Culture
* Eva Ilouz
  * personal grooming
  * leisure activities (restaurant visits, card rides, movies, vacations, dancing)
  * "eternal excitement through intence experiences"
  * romance was transfered from the home to the public sphere (partially class issue-> working class homes were too crowded to receive guests and have some privacy with them)
* Beauty Industry: um anderen zu gefallen
* Dating websites
* Hochzeiten

1.5) Kaputtes Körperbild -> Essstörungen, im Extremfall auch Tod

1.6) Rechtfertigen, gar glorifizieren und normalisieren Gewalt als "universselles menschliches Begehren"
* Neruda (zb "El tigre") + Seminar
* Popularität von 50 Shades of Gray (Jetzt ohne der SM Szene nahe treten zu wollen, aber ich glaub, die findens auch scheiße)

2) Vlt sind nicht die Stories schuld
2.1) Limerence
* auch als Reaktion/Reflektion zum Kapitel Kopfkino, wo auch immer der reingehört
* Def,...

2.2) Wir brauchen meaningful zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen
* vgl Brené Brown
* vgl Jo March ("... but I am so lonely")
  -> Idee: Iwo die Szene wo sie rantet anfangen, und hier noch mit diesem letzten Satz nochmal aufgreifen

3) Aber wir brauchen auch andere Stories

3.0) Witzigerweise long held view
Eva Illouz, p.50:"Then, as now, magazine columns held the emerging mass culture responsble for instilling the new ideal of romance and rejected it on the grounds that it was a Hollywood invention, criticizing it with the same vocabulary they used to criticize mass media. The perception of romance as a purely fictional or cinematic entity, indirectly supported by studies claiming that movie images were increasingly shaping people's cogintion and behavior, tapped into the old idea that novels and other popular forms of romantic representation cultivated false and unrealistic ideas."

3.1) Apell breitere Definitionen von "Love" zu nehmen?
* bell hooks "all about love"
* Brené Brown "Daring greatly"

3.2) Being enough (Brené Brown)
* selbstwert ist *nicht* am Haben einer Beziehung geknüpft
* nicht validation und alles mögliche emotional von der *einen* idealisierten romantischen Beziehung haben wollen

3.3) Regenbogen families
* D.: "Ich dachte dann, mir ist wichtiger, ein Kind zu haben als eine romantische Beziehung."
* Sich fragen wozu heiraten gut ist (anstatt zu jammern, dass die moderne Gesellschaften marriage verderben: "Public discussions of love during the first decades of the twentieth century were dominated by the perception that the institution of marriage was undergoing a major crisis.", Eva Illouz)

3.4) TODO: Check "Die singuläre Frau"

## Form
*" Combination of story (of the characters), how they navigate the challenges; and more "theoretical" pages
* Framing story: L searching for what's love; (compare beginning of Dykes to Watch out for)
    4) "What's love"
    4.1) "love is
      .. a battle field"
      .. war" - war metaphors
    4.2  .. a losing game"
    4.3  .. blind" -> limerence
    4.4  .. love" -> tautology, undefinierbar?
    4.5 bell hooks' definition --> so far missing;
    TODO: Come back to the framing story


Idea: Listening to "Too much love will kill you" as closing credits
"Too much love will kill you, just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you, make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy, you're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time"

## Notes
* Relevant facetes of "love"
  * limerence
  * family
    -> when is what you have in a family love? Vgl bell hooks with "care/providing for children!=love
    -> and her definition of love
  * romantic love
  * feminist critique of heterosexual romantic love in 2er relationships and small families as estranging people from community and leaving them to deal with political issues in private
  ("you and me against the world baby")
  * the beauty project -> "all the woman is fit for is love" (and they can be watching little women in fact; also good quote "I should think, a woman has some power over her affections." - "I think, the poets might disagree" -> someone commenting "I never thought, I'd come to love Amy March)
    "one woman enterpreneurship" -> the pencil rock; the time you spent to pluck your beard, because leg and armpit hairs are "accepted" in the meantime, but no one is talking about more "abnormal" hair
  * Outlander:
    Comment "A friend of mine actually moved to Inverness a married a Scottish man"
    Answer: "Someone didn't quite get the meaning of an escapist fantasy.."

  * romantic love and beauty expectations kill people (vgl Laurie Penny with annorexia; or Geri as a matter of fact)
 
* Further odd quotes
Caitlin Moran:
"I'd never known how alone you can feel lying next to someone."
"Along with underwear, love is a woman's work. Women are to be fallen in love with. When we discuss the tragedies that can possibly befall a woman, once we have discounted war and injury, it is the idea of being unloved, and therefore, unwanted, that we wince over the most." -> vgl Jo, Little Women

* Listening to songs like
"Love is a battlefield",
"What's love got to do with it? What's love but a second hand emotion. Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken";
"Most girls"? (Hailee Stainfield);
"The one" (Kodaline?) (or as a matter of fact anything singing about "the one");
"We belong"?
"Светът е за 2ма",
Bon Jovi/Bryan Adams;

"Is this love" - White Snake -> in P's story
"Too much love will kill you"
"All you need is love" -> in Mini break to Paris

"I looked around an' what did I see
Broken hearted people staring at me,
All searching 'cos they still believe,
Oh, love ain't no stranger

I was alone an' I needed love
So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of,
I heard no warning, but, a heart can tell
I'd feel the emptiness of love I know so well

Love ain't no stranger"

Tainted Love
Love Hurts - Nazareth
Say Love - James TW Lyrics (Say love say love say love say love) -> das ist mehr cautionary tale eigentlich
Can't buy me love.. "I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love."

* Hanging as a poster
"No love for a nation" - hängt in Kopfkino 1 in der Küche

## Outline for the comic

0) Intro

0.1) Transition to main part:
compile resources where the research takes place: Unspeakable Things; all about love; How to Be a Woman; Unterum Frei; Real Life TM; (movies?)
M enters and asks whatever's the matter;
The project is described

1) Meant to be's and only ones: Romantic (heterosexual couple) love 

"It's not that I don't believe in romantic love, in LoveTM.
It patently exists. People shape their lives to stories, and sometimes it works." 
-- and sometimes it doesn't^^, leaving you feeling inferior
"LoveTM is not true love, in the sense that many other kinds of love are also true."

"But the relatively recent cultural narrative of The One — the idea that everyone has a soulamte whom they are destined to love for ever, and that your life will always be incomplete if you fail to meet, mate and move in with that person — that's not just implausible, it's cruel."
-- vgl "If there's only one person for you in the whole world and you lose them, does that mean that you have to live the rest of your life without anyone else? I think you, we, anyone, has to be open to possibilities"

"The people for whom LoveTm works [...] are in the minority.
Now that we are not obliged to choose between celibate loneliness and yoking ourselves for ever to a person we may grow to despise, most people's lives contain many important relationships, and sometimes those relationships fade or fizzle out.
That may not fit in with the dominant ideology — that monogamous marriage is the only possible healthy way to live,love and distribute welfare benefits — but it's a more accurate map of the human heart"

1.2) Love is the only thing a woman is fit for
-> Dann Übergang zu Kritik an Societal expectations of women and love (Ist das das Fazit?)

1.2.1) 2 seiten, wo sie Little Women gucken

- Amy March
"Well, I Believe We Have Some Power Over Who We Love. It Isn’t Something That Just Happens To A Person."
Laurie: "I think the poets might disagree." <- the poets are largely white male (and middle class, so they have no economic concerns)
Amy: "Well, I'm not a poet. I'm just a woman. And as a woman, there's no way for me to make my own money. Not enough to earn a living, or support my family. And if I had my own money, which I don't, that money would belong to my husband, the moment we got married. And if we had children, they would be his, not mine. They would be his property. So don't sit there and tell me that marrage isn't an economic proposition, because it is. It may not be for you, but it most certainly is for me."
  
Comment: "I've never thought, I'd come to love Amy March."

"The idea that we have no control over who we love and what we do about it is one of the most disempowering things girls are ever told.
Loneliness is a fearful thing.
But a life lived grasping for another person to make you whole is just as fearful.
If you see yourself as incomplete without a partner to be your 'other half', you will always be lonely, even in a partnership."
//vgl Amy March; vgl two halves of an orange;


- Jo March: "Women, they have minds, and they have souls, as well as just hearts. 
And they’ve got ambition, and they’ve got talent, as well as just beauty. 
And I’m so sick of people saying that love is just all a woman is fit for. I'm so sick of it.
But I'm so lonely."
Comment2: "The story of my life"

Comment 3: "You know nothing much seems to have changed since 1860.."

Combine somehow with Laurie Penny and love stories are the only stories girls are cast (and consequently cast themselves) as the main characters of.
(Vgl auch Little Women: "And if the main character is a girl, make sure she is married by the end.")
LP: "What they were looking for was what every woman and girl is still, always, supposed to be looking for: love.
For monogamous, marriage-minded romantic partnership with the man of their dreams.
Every girl's story was a love story."

Caitlin Moran:
"Language tells us exactly what we think of the unattached woman - it's all there in the difference between 'bachelors' and 'spinsters'. Bachelors have it all to play for. Spinsters must play for it all, and fast. The market demand tells you a woman's value: if she's single she is unwanted, and therefore — should this state of affairs go on for any length of time — less desirable.
So givent the importance women know is attached to them being attached it is little wonder that women are obsessed with the idea of love, and relationships."

LP: "Women learn to fear being 'left on the shelf', to associate it with poverty and isolation."

Laurie Penny
"LoveTM has become devotional, especially for women.
We search for it, profess belief in it, make sacrifices for it."

"We are all encouraged to feel sorry for ourselves if we are single, to consider ourselves incomplete, but women in particular are urged to consider themselves inferior if their time in not spent comforting and cosseting a man, and ideally, children too."
-- the two halves of an orange

1.2.2) Beauty expectations and standards
romantic love and beauty expectations kill people (vgl Laurie Penny with annorexia; or Geri as a matter of fact) 

Geschichte zu
Sich vor Augen führen warum ich nicht für ne Beziehung geeignet bin: Eigene Attraktivität assess; Male gaze? Körperbehaarung; Beauty project

- expensive (in terms of money) and also very time-consuming
  (and in terms of being destructive)

    "one woman enterpreneurship" -> the pencil rock; the time you spent to pluck your beard, because leg and armpit hairs are "accepted" in the meantime, but no one is talking about more "abnormal" hair

"My brother once told me he'd never take to bed a woman who wears chucks." -> inspiring a friend's transition to a "proper woman" and leaving me torn between thinking "what a steaming pile of bullshit" and "maybe I should take heed if I want a guy ever looking at me"

"Women across the classes are taught to seek the love of men first, to assess our worth on the basis of how good we are at keeping and holding male attention.
And across the classes, romantic humiliation can be used to bring women low."
(vgl vlt Ch's "Früher dacht ich, es wäre ein Kompliment, wenn mir jemand nen Klaps auf den Hintern verpasst.")

1.2.3) to be in love with the idea of being in love
- trying so hard so that you project onto people just for the sake of loving something/one
- Caitlin Moran's story (being "in love" with an asshole) (see 1.1)
- being in a relationship for the sake of being in a relationship
  -> a story about that would be nice
- imagining relationships with celebrities/frined/ppl you vaguely know (see Limerence)

* Outlander:
Comment "A friend of mine actually moved to Inverness a married a Scottish man"
Answer: "Someone didn't quite get the meaning of an escapist fantasy.."

LP
"The quest for Great Love is the ultimate devotion, the ultimate sign of being a good woman who can command the interest of men."
"LoveTM demands demonstrations of faith in the face of logic.
'The perfect person is out there,' we say to our friends who are single and sad, as if merely repeating the mantra might make it so."

Me bying into stores and being invested in them
vgl also Timeless
(or is it simply because the heroine is called Lucy?)

"And of every possible definition of love, it is romantic love between couples, monogamous sexual and social commitment between two people that is considered the most important."
-> Vgl Outlander: Claire gets back in time to be with Jamie
(and at some point has a melt-down realising that she left her whole life, friends and work she loves behind. Which then miraculously disappears, never to be questioned again.)
"This is no accident.
    Love and fucking are the field on which gender gets personal.
Where stereotypes are cast in craving and formed in bitterness on every side."

Caitlin Moran's secret messages story -> "You can always tell when a woman is with the wrong man, bacause she has so much to say about the fact that nothing's happening"

Remark from teenage years:
"To have a crush in school is a way to experience some excitement, to partake in the collective ritual all girls seem to take part in"

"When we talk about love conquering all, when we speak, in that glazed, cultish way, of love's healing power.. we are not talking about love in its broadest sense.
We are not referring to the actual practice of caring for a person and being cherished in return, or of giving of oneself for another, whether that be a friend, a family member, a lover or a stranger."
"The notion of romance that we are all encouraged to go searching for is something different.
It is something smaller and more specific.
It is love as ritual and as product, [..] love whose highest ideal is still hererosexual, monogamous romance leading eventually to lasting marriage."
-> "as ritual": vgl Teenies/Pretenies and Crushes: it is a ritual; something to participate in ("ich hab fast das gefühl, ein teil davon war, nur um da mitzumachen und sich mit iwas zu beschäftigen")
Quote again and extend the panel where everyone is in love with Nico (but doesn't really know him;
and title character is in love with him as well at the end)
L: das ist ne reelle geschichte aus der 12. klasse. das peinlichste ist, als ich dann doch rausgefunden hab, wer das ist, war ich auch ein wenig in ihn verliebt
I: Scheint ja toller tüp gewesen zu sein
L: keine ahnung. ich kannte ihn ja nicht wirklich. der konnte schön lächeln, hat viel quatsch gemacht, was unterhaltsam war, und iwann saß ich tatsächlich mit dem und noch ein paar leute paar stunden lang mitte in der nacht in ner berghütte aufm boden im flur und haben da ne gitarre durch die gegend gereicht. das ist ungefähr alles was ich zu ihm berichten kann
(ich glaub, der rest da vom fanclub kannte ihn ungefähr genau so viel^^)
I: Ich hatte als jugendliche nie reale Schwärme und dachte immer, mit mir stimmt was nicht
L: ich hab fast das gefühl, ein teil davon war, nur um da mitzumachen und sich mit iwas zu beschäftigen 

"This sort of love is valued above every other, even though it is now a minority practice, and even though the many millions who are living happily in such partnerships find the reality far more complex than is considered proper to discuss."
-> no one acknowledges it is actually hard work to maintain a working relationship; a lot of communication, time, energy;

1.1) The tortured romantic hero (and by extension also heroine?) Also dieser Kapitel wo es darum geht, dass Leiden aus Liebe romantisiert wird

"I believe in feeling bad for love. I think it is, somehow, glorious. I am stupid. I am so stupid."- Caitlin Moran
(maybe combine with 1.2.4) romantic love and beauty expectations kill people)

"Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat like
we're nothing?
We accept the love we think we deserve"

1.3) Limerence
Couple of sketches illustrating Limerence

Chapter Kopfkino

Rahmengeschichte: 1.3.1 is recounted to the room mate in the kitchen

1.3.1) my story about P
- pre-story? vlt in ner Rückblende (Comment T: "You talk an awful lot about P." Me: "Duh, that's because we're working on the same project and it's the person I'm spending the most time with at the moment."; Situation that felt like flirting:"You're not cool if you don't smoke"-"That's quite alright, I can live with not being cool."; Looks over the monitor?)
-  checkin round where P explains their 10 year old relationship is over "scary excitement"
- being disconcerted for a week
- going over all these scenarios in head, mulling over what is expected of me; should I say something? is it too early? do I really want something from him? Or is it that I just feel excited about something happening, regardless of that person, which would be enormously unfair to him? What is it that he wants? Am I the person responsible for his relationship breaking? And what is expected of me now? If it breaks it would be very weird, we are co-workers. And it would be weird because we're also friends with our co-workers who may feel compelled to take sides. Also, I am very unable of behaving in a relationship. I don't have time for the shit. I'm most probably just imagining the whole thing and it was never flirting in the first place.
it was nice and easy when it was clear that he was in a relationship. and suddenly scarry when he wasn't anymore because it became a real possibility that something might actually happen
- filling in all silences in the next 3 days out of terror something might happen
- being very exhausted by end of the week bc of sleep deprivation and talking a lot; feeling quezy; sich ärgern, dass die Therapeutin in Urlaub is

Room mate introduces this story
1.3.2) Caitlin Moran's story about tights in Paris -> Die wird von einem Character wieder gegeben: "Weißt du, das erinnert mich total an diese Story aus How to be a woman"
- Sitting on desk; looking at person; ..


1.3.3) Flashbacks to school
6th grade: "My boyfriend" (who knew nothing of the ordeal)
12th grade: everybody is in love with nico
0.1) Character dreaming in their head of romantic encounters; and then behaving accordingly absurd when they meet the person in person
Caitlin Moran: "But this febrile ability to move intense, imaginary relationships often spills over into relationships that actually exist, blurring the line between the real relationship and the imaginary one." (vgl auch me in 6. grade)
Question:
-> Jane Austen already remarked on this too: "A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment."

Omniscient narrator recountering:
+ Theoretical Page on Limerence ("There is a word for that, although none of them suspects it existed. Psychologists call this 'limerence.'")
% "the authors definition of Limerence being “an involuntary potentially inspiring state of adoration and attachment to a LO involving intrusive and obsessive thoughts, feelings and behaviours from euphoria to despair, contingent on perceived emotional reciprocation”
% "ruminative thinking being an obsessive, repetitive, addictive, time consuming distractive state which impacted on normal daily activity."
% "These included feelings of confusion, destabilisation and being out of control, even to the point of stalking a LO" -> vgl El Tigre
% ", with the LO as an “idealised” (R6) person, as reflected in the perception of LO characteristics as “flawless and godlike” (R5)."
% "it is a creation within the Limerent person themselves"
% "The person experiencing Limerence has unmet relational needs, wants, desires, often from childhood, that somehow crystalise into a laser focused, intense desire for a single person (i.e., the LO) (R5)."
% "Limerence is an unexpected, overwhelming and debilitating experience that relates to the feeling of ‘being in love’ but in an intense form which is often, though not always, unreciprocated usually resulting in negative outcomes. The condition has been implicated as a major cause of relationship and family breakdown, as well as being related to anti-social behaviours, including stalking and self-harm (Tennov, 2005). The term was originally described by Tennov (1979), who noted that a Limerent individual becomes obsessed with securing emotional reciprocation, uses imagined reciprocation as temporary relief and has an intense fear of rejection from the focus of their attention (the Limerent Object/LO)."


"Both stories, LoveTM and SexTm, hold us up to impossible standards.
Both demand that we see another person as less than human, merely a body filling a prewritten role in our script or romantic or erotic extasy.
Both are wildly unrealistic, and both set us up to fail."
-> Beweis for love is work; for stories spoilt me for relationships; also vgl limerence


1.4) Titel/Konzept fehlt (Vlt ist eher das der "Meant to be's and only ones" chapter). Aber im Grunde: Bücher und Filme/Stories have made me incapable of relationships. They've set so many unrealistic expectations.
That's not how relationships work. Relationships are hard work.

   * iwas mit 2 Hälften der Orange.. bzw die Orange besteht doch aus mehreren Stücken^^

  * feminist critique of heterosexual romantic love in 2er relationships and small families as estranging people from community and leaving them to deal with political issues in private
  ("you and me against the world baby")

"The more I talk to people about love and work and gender and sex and power, the more it comes down to[..] the stories we tell ourselves and how they map on to our experience of real human beings trying to fit our messy, meaty hearts into the anatomically inaccurate totem of romance."
-> Vgl: Stories spoilt me for romantic love (and also for any love bc I am aspiring to the unreachable ideal of the romantic love) because they created unrealistic expectations of it is supposed to look like.
And the thing about stories is, they are not real.
"the thing about stories is that somebody made them up"

-> Also, I don't have time for a relationship
"I was no longer That Girl.
I didn't have time to save boys any more.
I had other priorites, and those priorities included writing.
You cannot be a writer and have writing be anything other than the central romance of your life"

"LoveTM is meant to be the overwhelming object of a woman's early life; her story ends when she finds it, or fails to find it.
The most important thing is that her story ends."
"young men [...] have so many other stories to work with"
"Little girls, though, only ever get two choices: we can be the princess, or we can be the witch." //Actually, I think we could also be the fairy godmother (which is probably also the only positive narrative for an elderly woman who is not married)

"This is why female artists and women writers remain figures of suspicion.
Men are allowed to make their work, their practice, the central romance of their lives.
Men are allowed to love their art, their writing, their passion, a little bit more than anything else.
Women are not, and if we choose to do so anyway, we will always be seen as lacking something, or taking on a man's role, or both.
Whatever else we do with our lives, we must carve out part of our hearts in the service of others, or we are not really women.
We are permitted to be the wives and lovers of great men, but if we try to become great ourselves [..] there must be something wrong with us."

Stories for girls to cast themselves in
(comment on Kate Middleton cult)
"As social mobility collapes, princess propaganda is enjoying a shocking pink renaissance, hooking grown women who should know better into the hoary old narrative of One True Love leading inexorably to titular rights to the Duchy of Lancaster.
When we grow up, the princess becomes the shining girl, the good girlfriend.
It may look less likely we'll inherit Cornwall, but we can still be somebody else's beautiful sidekick, which is the best thing a girl can be.
We talk a lot about women as sex objects, but the reduction of women to love objects does just as much damage;[..]
The love object is a thing to be desired and pitied all at once.
She is the helpmeet, the saint, the fantasy.
She is never a complete person.
Whatever attributes make her interesting — maybe she can cook, or sew, or shoot a gun, or solve a crime — she exists ultimately for the hero's edification.
She is nothing without him."
-> Vgl Jo March "I'm sick of .. love is the only thing a woman is fit for."; 
and manic pixie dream girl;
vgl also limerence -> this is limerence, but from a male perspective

"I was a manic pixie dream girl"
-> yeah, me too

"Women behave in was that they find sanctioned in stories written by men who know better, and men and women seek out friends and partners who remind them of a girl they met in a book one day when they were young and longing."
"For me, Manic Pixie Dream Gril was the story that fit."
Following description on why -> adapt this
"I had the raw materials: I'm five feet nothing, petite and small-featured with skin the colour of something left on the bottom of a pond for too long and messy hair that's sometimes dyed a shocking shade of red or pink.
At least, it was before I washed all the dye out last year, partly to stop soulful Zach-Braff-a-likes following me to the shops.
And, yes, I'm a bit strange and sensitive and daydreamy, and, yes, I retain a somwhat embarassing belief in the ultimate decency of humanity and the transformative brilliance of music, lathough I'm ambivalent on the Shins.
I love to dance, I play the guitar badly, and I also — since we are in confession mode, dear reader, hear and forgive — I also play the fucking ukulele. Truly."
-> For the adaptation: I also have messy hair, which I hated when growing up bc it essentially allowed one hairstyle: this what my mother called " an unraveled basket" or "kicked around cabbage"; and in which at some point I started to take some weird pride, bc it was easier that way since it required zero action and it was something people seemed to like (which I was always kind of suspicious towards);
tried dying my hair pink, but never went the whole way of actually bleaching it first, partially out of fear that it'll fall out and partially out of plain old lazyness.
I did cut half of it once, due do a drunken bet though.
I play the guitar, or rather, used to, initially forced into it by my parents since "we have no space to put in a piano, but here's you father's old guitar" and rather lacklusterly; (which may have partially been due to the teachers who came from classical music and never seemed to have anything interesting to play) later; I took a liking to it, partially bc it seemed cool and you know "this is what girls fall for" (or maybe the boys?)
I walked around in middle school, the time when girls fought wars over Britney Spears vs Christina Agilera and Spice Girls vs Backstreet Boys, telling everyone that my favourite band was Queen, of which I've heard a grand total of 2 albums (or 3?), one of which was "Greatest Hits" (to be fair, I rather liked Queen and still do, so it was not a pose per se.)
I like to dance and sing, which I both do in a reasonably mediocre fashion, but it's fun.
In highschool, I went throught the obligatory phase of picking up street signs and cones and other random stuff of the streets and giving people cobble stones for their birthdays.
And of course, through the phase of doodling on your sneakers and drawing stuff on your own shirts (I even painted my prom dress).
And I also, "doubtless honed by that learned girlish desire to please", have always gone out of my way to include new people in groups.

"But the Manic Pixie is never a point-of-view character, and she isn't understood from the inside.
She's one of those female tropes who is permitted precisely no interiority.
Instead of a personality, she has eccentricities, a vaguely offbeat favourite band, a funky fringe."
"Most of the classic Manic Pixie Dream Girls claim to be ironic re-imaginings of a character trope that they fail to actually interrogate in any way.
Irony is, of course, the last vestige of modern crypto-misogyny: all those lazy stereotypes and hurtful put-downs are definitely a joke, right up until they aren't, and clearly youneed a man to tell you when and if you're supposed to take sexism seriously."
"Men write women, and they rewrite us, for revenge.
It's about obsession, and control."
"[...] Kazan told the Huffington Post.
'Everybody is setting out to write a full character.
It's just that some people are limited in their imagination of a girl. '


"She doesn't get a story. She is part of a story that happens to other people."
"Men grow up expecting to be the hero of their own story.
Women grow up expecting to be the supporting actress in somebody else's."
-> Vgl Daisy Jones. (Und Margarete Stokowski)

"If we want anything interesting at all to happen to us we have to be a story that happens to somebody else"

"Lady hobbits didn't bring the ring to Mordor. They stayed at home in the Shire."
-> Vlt kann man iwie die 20sec Zusammenschnitt of 2 women interacting in the whole LOTR trilogy einbauen.
"Just as many of us, however, spend our lives trying to mould ourselves into love objects.
Almost every female protagonist, in every story written or designed by men, is a love object: a creature fabricated to fulfil a role in somebody else's grand narrative."
-> Vgl Daisy Jones: "I'm not a muse. I'm somebody. End of the fucking story."
"The love object is always a supporting character[...]
She delights, she entices, she is slender and beautiful and whimsical and invariably poorly written, and so many of us spend a great deal of time trying to be her.
Stories shape us, even the shit ones.
Even the ones that are simplistic and obviate a great deal of real-life experience by design.
Stories are how we organise our lives, how we streamline our desires, and sometimes they fall short, and sometimes they disappoint us, and they always matter.
For women, love stories are the stories we are allowed to cast ourselves in, and those are the stories that shape our cravings and identities."
-> They get me every fucking time (except the ones that are really really poorly written. Maybe I should move to Inverness as well^^)

"a choice to stop being That Girl and start becoming a grown woman, which is the worst possible thing a girl can do, which is why so many of those Manic Pixie Dream Girl characters, as written by male geeks and scriptwriters, either die tragically young or are somehow immortally fixed at the physical and mental age of nineteen and a half.
Meanwhile, in th real world, the very worst thing about being a real-life MPDG is the look of disappointment on the face of someone you really care about when they find out you're not their fantasy at all — you're a real human who breaks wind and has a job."

"And it's a struggle.
Because I reamin a small, friendly, excitable person who wears withy colours and has a tendency towards the twee."

"So, here's what I've learned, in twenty-seven years of reading books and kissing boys.
Firstly, avaregely pretty white women in their late teens and twenties are not the biggest, most profoundly unsolvable mystery in the universe. [...]
Those of us with an ounce of lust for life are almost universally less interesting than we will be in our thirties and forties."
"The one abiding secret about us is that we're not fantasies, and we weren't made to save you: we are real people, with flaws and cracked personalities and big dreams and digetive tracts."


Finish with why we buy into them, transition to "that's how they keep you in line" (by making you fear the loss of love)

1.5) "But deep down, I know if I choose not to play the good girl game, I might not get as many kisses as I want.
And that's so much more terrifying."

"This, then, is how women are kept in line.
The threat of violence is a fearful thing, but its injustice is clear, and there is always the risk of rebellion. [..]
To tell a person that if they don't do what they're told they will never be loved is an existential threat akin to soul murder.
'If you do not do this, you will be beaten' is ultimately far less effective than 'if you do not do this, nobody will love you.'
It is that fear that keeps us cowed and conformist."
"We don't pare ourselves down and tart ourselves up and process our personality into the mould deemed most pleasing by mainstream culture because we're stupid, or cowardly.
We do it because we fear loss of love.
We do it because we grew up learning, unless our parents were particularly enlightened, that we were unworthy of love unless we conformed to a certain set of rules about how to look, dress and behave."
"If you do follow all the rules, if you ever get it perfectly right, then, of course, you're a dull bimbo, a brainless fembot, just as unworthy of male respect as the ones who didn't."
"But men, too, have equal power of refusal in relationships.
They can refuse to give of themselves in a way that is equally humiliating to women who have grown up learning that they were failing on a basic level if they could not command the love and commitment of men.
And that's it. That's how heterosexuality makes us all miserable."

The story about "but I only kiss very beautiful girls"
"He's drunk. He doesn't mean to be that much of a prick.
But we both know what he means, and it hurts because he's right: I'm not the sort of girl who gets kissed by boys like that.
I'm not a sexy little package. I'm scrappy and opinionated....."
"And for a moment that sins out reeling in the hurt, private parts of the heart, I wish I was a different kind of girl.
A girl like the girl I see the same boy rolling under a blanket with in the communal bedding area two hours later, soft-spoken with long, pretty hair.
I am eaten up by jealousy, and that's how they get you.
It's the night before a big march, but I abandon sleep.
Instead, I get the laptop out and take it to a place where people are too stoned and sleepy to take notice of my pathetic little tears.
This is stupid. There's work to be done.
Tomorrow tens of thousands of us are going to take to the streets to demand fair access to education, and my smashed little heart shouldn't matter. But it odes.
The whole world is changing, and I just want to be the kind of girl who gets taken in somebody's arms.
[...]
I think about maybe growing my hair out and wearing more skirts.
And that's how they get you.
That's how they keep you in line."

Maybe put here the story about the brother; or put this entire thing together with the beauty expectations and keeping in line

"I was prepared for the personal to be political.
What I didn't understand until quite recently was that the political can be so, so personal."

1.6) Not sure wohin damit

"And yet love, romantic love, is the one thing we're not supposed to queston.
Why not?"

"Religion, like opium, was a refuge from the anxieties of the age, replacing personal, individual dispair with a whole new set of problems.
Right now, romantic love as we know it functions in much the same way."
"We don't just fall for all of this romantic faff because we're stupid, or guillable, or weak.
We fall because we want to, because we need to believe that something will make the rest of our lives safe and meaningful.
The postures of romance, particularly straight, married romance, allow us to reject the grim meat-hook reality of work and death even as they fashion us for it, pairing us off into little pockets of pain and passion: you and me against the world, baby."
->vlt include cupcake poem??
"To Laurie Penny
Romantic love, we're told, is something rare and precious,
shared love is like the sweet sweet icing of a double-chocolate cupcake:
two hearts and two souls melt into one sticky sugary substance in a paper muffin form.
Each one in its own separate private nest on the muffin pan conform
with what they told us love was like: "The two of us against the world",
                                                and if by some mistake
the dough spills over and more cupcakes on the pan connect
the baker throws them in the trash without a second thought or due respect."

"You can use it [human passion] to isolate people in antagonistic pairs and let them blame each other for the structural lack of sweetness in the world."
-> New idea?

2) Till death do us part: Weddings
  - expensive
   "I've told all my friends, no more of them are to marry this summer, I'm completely broke."
  - hypocritical event
    - invite ppl you don't really care about

  - why?
    - societal expectations
    - archaic custom
    - tax (bc of archaic custom)

    Caitlin Moran: "THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. 'It's the best day of your life'. The snags here are obvious. Of cousre it's not the best day of your life. A day that was really the best day of your life wouldn't involve Uncle Wrong, Aunt Drip, and someone from your office you had to invite, lest you spend the next six years being sulked at every time you pass them in a stairwell. Clearly - with these enforced parameters - your wedding is actually like some unholy melange of some works away day and family therapy, and should, therefore, be regarded wit the same mixture of quite stoicism, grim determination and heavy drinking."

  Antira Hochzeiten?

"Because it turns out that LoveTM is also the theoretical basis for most of the work done for free, largely by women, so that the mechanisms of profit and production can be maintained.
Most of the work of childcare, cooking, cleaning, personal care, helpmeeting and mopping up your husband's ego after a hard day's wage labour is not recognised as 'real work' because it is done out of 'love'"
"a lot of work that women do remains unpaid or underpaid because we think of it as 'love', as a moral expression of feelng rather than a practical task of immense and tangible value"

"For men, LoveTm is more likely to mean continuing in one's occupation of choice with the support of a partner who cherishes and believes in you, will take care of you when work exhausts you, will handle all the arrangements for the care and upbringing of your children so you don't have to hink about it, and will provide you with your preferredform of sexual release at the end of the working day."

".. and even a minority who work as primary carers for children, but that minority is still small — and enormously culturally underrepresented to the extent that such arrangements still fail to register in the life plans of most young men."
-- die dann auch krass gefeiert werden, dass sie ein bisschen Zeit mit ihren Kindern verbracht haben

"For men, love is supposed to be the reward you get in return for work; for women, love is work in itself."

"Your job is now your boyfriend: neither of them can be trusted to stick around, so you'd better make sure they know how much you love them."
-- or maybe move all of these to the part where relationships are work

"Marriage used to be understood as an essentially economic arrangement."-> vgl Amy March

On marriage:
"'the net effect of the neoliberal economic policies imposed in recent decades has been to push economic and social responsibility away from eployers and government and onto private households.[...] In more and more cases, the sole remaining resoure is the cooperative, mutually supporting household or kinship netowrk. 
But if marriage is the symbolic and legal anchor or households and kinship networks, and marriage is increasingly unstable, how relable will that source of support be?'" (quoting Richard Kim and Lisa Duggan from "Beyound Gay Marriage")

3) An ode to my family: Other facettes of love
    -> when is what you have in a family love? Vgl bell hooks with "care/providing for children!=love
    -> and her definition of love

3.1) Other facettes of love?
"Love is a gendered thing.
It also makes life worth living and politics worth doing.
Everyone seems to agree that love is important — but what sort of love?"
"Part of the problem is our lack of language to describe love, and that problem is political.
Semantic context collapse means that we only have one word, 'love', for the vast spectrum of passion and compassion, compresion and care that make our species worth saving.
The English language has hundreds of thousands of words,[..], but only one to describe the very thing we're told is most important."
-> Idea: Struggling with this; Spoken-word performance of bell hooks (and her definition of love)



5) End of part 1: Either "Too much love will kill you" (Otherwise think where to put it)
or
Wimmelbild-like: being desperate and not being able to read stories to the end because they are shit, because they only cast women in such narrow preconcieved roles (marry/fall in disgrace/die/all three of them/ be raped multiple times along the way)
Examples for that: Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina, One hundred years of solitude

LP:
"Back in the real world, most people's lives exist on a spectrum somewhere between One True Love and meaningless rutting.
Even those of us taken in by the fantasy know this to be the case, and yet it's frowned upon to speak of that spectrum in positive terms.
We are required instead to acknowledge that any person or pair of persons failing to achieve LoveTM or SexTm are doomed to live terribly sad lives"


## Part 2: Wendepunkt -> we need better stories; we need other, more diverse stories
We need new stories; we need to democratise the meaning of "love"; for everyone;
bell hooks + her definition of love in Mittelpunkt
Stories sammeln: Frozen? Shadow Hunters?; Wheel of Time (male gaze!)

maybe here for
LP: 
"The colonisation of love by capitalist patriarchy is a deeply painful thing.
It means that structural sexism and cultural violence are played out on small, private stages, which is what makes them so very hard to recognise and resist.
    Human love is radical, and it is devastating.
And human love has been thoroughly captured by neoliberalism, by the mindset and mechanisms of profit."

"If we want to escape the straitjacket of gender under neoliberalism, we must stop trying so hard to hold ourselves and others up to impossible standards, standards we didn't set ourselves.
We have to resist the schooled inner voice teling us to be good girls, tough boys, perfect women, strong men.
If we are to realise a greater collective humanity, we must learn to see one another as human beings first."

"We must refuse to judge others by any standard other than that of kindness and decency.
We must not start out by apologising for all that we are.
It's about saying no and expecting that no to be respected."

"Because when we are done hating oursleves and hurting each other, wecanget on with asking for what should be ours by right."

"No wonder increasing numbers of young people are exploring options — polyamory, open relationships, extended circles of chosen family and fuckbuddies"
