# Life Writing Project "What's love got to do with it"

## Idea
* Several characters who grapple with "love" in different senses/perspectives

## Form
* Combination of story (of the characters), how they navigate the challenges; and more "theoretical" pages

## Notes
* Relevant facetes of "love"
  * limerence
  * family
    -> when is what you have in a family love? Vgl bell hooks with "care/providing for children!=love
    -> and her definition of love
  * romantic love
  * feminist critique of heterosexual romantic love in 2er relationships and small families as estranging people from community and leaving them to deal with political issues in private
  ("you and me against the world baby")
  * the beauty project -> "all the woman is fit for is love" (and they can be watching little women in fact; also good quote "I should think, a woman has some power over her affections." - "I think, the poets might disagree" -> someone commenting "I never thought, I'd come to love Amy March)
    "one woman enterpreneurship" -> the pencil rock; the time you spent to pluck your beard, because leg and armpit hairs are "accepted" in the meantime, but no one is talking about more "abnormal" hair
  * Outlander:
    Comment "A friend of mine actually moved to Inverness a married a Scottish man"
    Answer: "Someone didn't quite get the meaning of an escapist fantasy.."

  * romantic love and beauty expectations kill people (vgl Laurie Penny with annorexia; or Geri as a matter of fact)
 
* Further odd quotes
Caitlin Moran:
"I'd never known how alone you can feel lying next to someone."
"Along with underwear, love is a woman's work. Women are to be fallen in love with. When we discuss the tragedies that can possibly befall a woman, once we have discounted war and injury, it is the idea of being unloved, and therefore, unwanted, that we wince over the most." -> vgl Jo, Little Women

* Listening to songs like "Love is a battlefield", "What's love got to do with it? What's love but a second hand emotion. Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken"; "Most girls"? (Hailee Stainfield); "The one" (Kodaline?) (or as a matter of fact anything singing about "the one"); "We belong"? "Светът е за 2ма", Bon Jovi/Bryan Adams; "Is this love" - White Snake


## Outline for the comic

1) Meant to be's and only ones: Romantic (heterosexual couple) love 

1.2) Love is the only thing a woman is fit for
-> Dann Übergang zu Kritik an Societal expectations of women and love (Ist das das Fazit?)

1.2.1) 2 seiten, wo sie Little Women gucken

- Amy March
"Well, I Believe We Have Some Power Over Who We Love. It Isn’t Something That Just Happens To A Person."
Laurie: "I think the poets might disagree." <- the poets are largely white male (and middle class, so they have no economic concerns)
Amy: "Well, I'm not a poet. I'm just a woman. And as a woman, there's no way for me to make my own money. Not enough to earn a living, or support my family. And if I had my own money, which I don't, that money would belong to my husband, the moment we got married. And if we had children, they would be his, not mine. They would be his property. So don't sit there and tell me that marrage isn't an economic proposition, because it is. It may not be for you, but it most certainly is for me."
  
Comment: "I've never thought, I'd come to love Amy March."

- Jo March: "Women, they have minds, and they have souls, as well as just hearts. 
And they’ve got ambition, and they’ve got talent, as well as just beauty. 
And I’m so sick of people saying that love is just all a woman is fit for. I'm so sick of it.
But I'm so lonely."
Comment2: "The story of my life"

Comment 3: "You know nothing much seems to have changed since 1860.."

Caitlin Moran:
"Language tells us exactly what we think of the unattached woman - it's all there in the difference between 'bachelors' and 'spinsters'. Bachelors have it all to play for. Spinsters must play for it all, and fast. The market demand tells you a woman's value: if she's single she is unwanted, and therefore — should this state of affairs go on for any length of time — less desirable.
So givent the importance women know is attached to them being attached it is little wonder that women are obsessed with the idea of love, and relationships."

1.2.2) Beauty expectations and standards
Geschichte zu
Sich vor Augen führen warum ich nicht für ne Beziehung geeignet bin: Eigene Attraktivität assess; Male gaze? Körperbehaarung; Beauty project

- expensive (in terms of money) and also very time-consuming
  (and in terms of being destructive)

    "one woman enterpreneurship" -> the pencil rock; the time you spent to pluck your beard, because leg and armpit hairs are "accepted" in the meantime, but no one is talking about more "abnormal" hair


1.2.3) to be in love with the idea of being in love
- trying so hard so that you project onto people just for the sake of loving something/one
- Caitlin Moran's story (being "in love" with an asshole) (see 1.1)
- being in a relationship for the sake of being in a relationship
  -> a story about that would be nice
- imagining relationships with celebrities/frined/ppl you vaguely know (see Limerence)

* Outlander:
Comment "A friend of mine actually moved to Inverness a married a Scottish man"
Answer: "Someone didn't quite get the meaning of an escapist fantasy.."

Caitlin Moran's secret messages story -> "You can always tell when a woman is with the wrong man, bacause she has so much to say about the fact that nothing's happening"

1.2.4) romantic love and beauty expectations kill people (vgl Laurie Penny with annorexia; or Geri as a matter of fact) 

1.1) The tortured romantic hero (and by extension also heroine?) Also dieser Kapitel wo es darum geht, dass Leiden aus Liebe romantisiert wird

"I believe in feeling bad for love. I think it is, somehow, glorious. I am stupid. I am so stupid."- Caitlin Moran
(maybe combine with 1.2.4) romantic love and beauty expectations kill people)

1.3) Limerence
Couple of sketches illustrating Limerence
0.1) Character dreaming in their head of romantic encounters; and then behaving accordingly absurd when they meet the person in person
Caitlin Moran: "But this febrile ability to move intense, imaginary relationships often spills over into relationships that actually exist, blurring the line between the real relationship and the imaginary one." (vgl auch me in 6. grade)
Question:

Or more my story about P?
- pre-story? vlt in ner Rückblende (Comment T: "You talk an awful lot about P." Me: "Duh, that's because we're working on the same project and it's the person I'm spending the most time with at the moment."; Situation that felt like flirting:"You're not cool if you don't smoke"-"That's quite alright, I can live with not being cool."; Looks over the monitor?)
-  checkin round where P explains their 10 year old relationship is over "scary excitement"
- being disconcerted for a week
- going over all these scenarios in head, mulling over what is expected of me; should I say something? is it too early? do I really want something from him? Or is it that I just feel excited about something happening, regardless of that person, which would be enormously unfair to him? What is it that he wants? Am I the person responsible for his relationship breaking? And what is expected of me now? If it breaks it would be very weird, we are co-workers. And it would be weird because we're also friends with our co-workers who may feel compelled to take sides. Also, I am very unable of behaving in a relationship. I don't have time for the shit. I'm most probably just imagining the whole thing and it was never flirting in the first place.
it was nice and easy when it was clear that he was in a relationship. and suddenly scarry when he wasn't anymore because it became a real possibility that something might actually happen
- filling in all silences in the next 3 days out of terror something might happen
- being very exhausted by end of the week bc of sleep deprivation and talking a lot; feeling quezy; sich ärgern, dass die Therapeutin in Urlaub is

More Caitlin Moran's story about tights in Paris? -> Die wird von einem Character wieder gegeben: "Weißt du, das erinnert mich total an diese Story aus How to be a woman"
- Sitting on desk; looking at person; ..

Or both: Chapter Kopfkino


+ Theoretical Page on Limerence ("There is a word for that, although none of them suspects it existed. Psychologists call this 'limerence.'")



1.4) Titel/Konzept fehlt (Vlt ist eher das der "Meant to be's and only ones" chapter). Aber im Grunde: Bücher und Filme/Stories have made me incapable of relationships. They've set so many unrealistic expectations.
That's not how relationships work. Relationships are hard work.

   * iwas mit 2 Hälften der Orange.. bzw die Orange besteht doch aus mehreren Stücken^^

  * feminist critique of heterosexual romantic love in 2er relationships and small families as estranging people from community and leaving them to deal with political issues in private
  ("you and me against the world baby")

2) Till death do us part: Weddings
  - expensive
   "I've told all my friends, no more of them are to marry this summer, I'm completely broke."
  - hypocritical event
    - invite ppl you don't really care about

  - why?
    - societal expectations
    - archaic custom
    - tax (bc of archaic custom)

    Caitlin Moran: "THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. 'It's the best day of your life'. The snags here are obvious. Of cousre it's not the best day of your life. A day that was really the best day of your life wouldn't involve Uncle Wrong, Aunt Drip, and someone from your office you had to invite, lest you spend the next six years being sulked at every time you pass them in a stairwell. Clearly - with these enforced parameters - your wedding is actually like some unholy melange of some works away day and family therapy, and should, therefore, be regarded wit the same mixture of quite stoicism, grim determination and heavy drinking."

  Antira Hochzeiten?

3) An ode to my family: Other facettes of love
    -> when is what you have in a family love? Vgl bell hooks with "care/providing for children!=love
    -> and her definition of love

4) "What's love"
4.1) "love is
  .. a battle field"
  .. war" - war metaphors
4.2  .. a losing game"
4.3  .. blind" -> limerence
4.4  .. love" -> tautology, undefinierbar?
4.5 bell hooks' definition
