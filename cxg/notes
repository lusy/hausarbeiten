Clitic Doubling and Clitic-Left Dislocation
in Spanish and Greek as Native and as L2 Grammars

Learners of Spanish, Greek (and Macedonian) have to
change from a phonetically null category into the use of overt agreement morphology in
subject and object position. The data indicate that English learners of Spanish or Greek,
especially the upper groups, show a tendency to prefer the clitic option. This can be
interpreted as the use of a generalized strategy that dictates the use of overt agreement
morphology in the form of clitics in these structures.

..
Features such as definiteness and
specificity which rule the choice of a clitic or an empty category in the target language do
play a role in these L2 learners ́ grammars. However, this role differs from the one they have
in native grammars. Their use appears to be based on the saliency of overt morphology in the
L2 grammars

The L2 Acquisition of Spanish Focus
Laura Domínguez

Usage-based (role of input)

Multiple Options: but there are rules which constrain the forms and contexts of use
--> even advanced L2 Spanish learners probably don't have enough input to map each option to the respective usecase efficiently;
due to lack of input constructions are often transfered from the L1

CLLD Example:
El pastel, lo ha traído Sara

First steps toward a usage-based theory
of language acquisition
Michael Tomasello

On usage based perspective

The linguistic skills that a person possesses at any given
moment in time - in the form of a ``structured inventory of symbolic
units'' - result from her accumulated experience with language across
the totality of usage events in her life. This accumulated linguistic
experience undergoes processes of entrenchment, due to repeated uses
of particular expressions across usage events, and abstraction, due to
type variation in constituents of particular expressions across usage
events.

Constructing another Language—
Usage-Based Linguistics in Second
Language Acquisition
SØREN W. ESKILDSEN

On usage based linguistics:

A core principle uniting these theories is the rejection of the syntax–lexicon
dichotomy ...

Language knowledge is seen as a structured inventory of symbolic units, that is form–meaning
patterns (Langacker 1987), of varying complexity (from morphemes to full
utterances) and abstractness (from fixed, perhaps idiosyncratic, concrete
formulas to abstract schematic templates which in turn sanction the single
instantiations).

UBL views language acquisition as experiential and item-based and
directed towards increased cognitive schematicity, going from formulas via
low-scope patterns to fully abstract constructions

Token and type frequencies are then thought to determine matters of
entrenchment and schematicity of recurring expressions and constructions.

In Tomasello’s (2003: 107) words, token frequency is frequency of a concrete
expression which ‘in the language learner’s experience tends to entrench
that expression in terms of the concrete words and morphemes involved’,
whereas type frequency ‘of a class of expressions determines the abstractness
or schematicity of the resulting construction’.

The maximalistic nature of the
linguistic inventory, however, guarantees that what is learned as specific is
not necessarily replaced over time by the more abstract constructional
knowledge acquired; rather, abstract patterns and their specific instantiations
may cohabit in the grammar (Achard 2007)

Selective Attention and Transfer Phenomena in L2 Acquisition:
Contingency, Cue Competition, Salience, Interference, Overshadowing,
Blocking, and Perceptual Learning
NICK C. ELLIS

first language is rational in the sense that acquisition produces an
end-state model of language
--> This paper considers the apparent irrationalities of L2
acquisition, that is the shortcomings where input fails to become intake.
