# bell hooks - all about love

## preface

"When I was a child, it was clear to me that life was not worth living if we did not know love."

"But it was love's absence that let me know how much love mattered."

"No other connection healed the hurt of that first abandonment [...]. For years I lived my life suspended, trapped by the past, unable to move into the future."

## introduction

".. in When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough, Harold Kushner writer: 'I am afdraid that we may be raising a generation of young people who will grow up afraid to love, afraid to give themselves completely to another person, because they will have seen how much it hurts to take the risk of loving and have it not work out. I am afraid that they will grow up looking for intimacy without risk,, for pleasure without significant emotional investment. They will be so fearful of the pain of disappointment that they will forgo the possibilities of love and joy.' Young people are cynical about love.
Ultimately, cynicism is the great mask of the disappointed and betrayed heart."
--> I find it scary indeed to give myself fully to another person. If I did, then what's left of me for me? If it didn't work out, or even if it did

"As I pored over nonfiction books on the subject of love, I was surprised to find that the vast majority of the "revered" books, ones used as reference works and even those popular as self-help books, have been written by men."
^^ I am not at all

"Most men feel that they receive love and therefore know what it feels like to be loved; women often feel we are in a constant state of yearning, wanting love but not receiving it."
-- vgl also LP
-- vgl Little Women:
Marmee: "Do you love him?"
Jo: "I care more about beeing loved"
Marmee: "It's not the same thing as loving."

"Back then, in every creative writing course the poets dedicated to the love poem were always male.
Indeed, the partner I left after many years first courted me with a love poem.
He had always been emotionally unavailable and not at all interested in love as either a topic of discussion or a daily life practicce, but he was absolutely confident that he had something meaningful to say on the subject.
I, on the other hand, thought all my grown-up attempts to write love poems were mushy and pathetic."
-- women have impostor syndrome, men explain thingsTM

"Contemplating death has always been a subject that leads me back to love."
"my first thought as I waited for test results was that I was not ready to die because I had not yet found the love my heart had been seeking"

"In popular culture love is always the stuff of fantasy.
Maybe this is why men have done most of the theorizing about love.
Fantasy has primarily been their domain, both in the sphere of cultural production and in everyday life.
Male fantasy is seen as something that can create reality, whereas female fantasy is regarded as pure escape."

"few writers, male or female, talk about the impact of patriarchy, the way in which male domination of women and children stands i nthe way of love"

"many people feel that they do not have a clue as to how to love"

"It is easier to articulate the pain of love's absence than to describe its presence and meaning in our lives."

"Taught to believe that the mind, not the heart, is the seat of learning, many of us believe that to speak of love with any emotional intensity means we will be perceived as weak and irrational."

"We want to know what it means to love, what we can do in our everyday lives to love and be loved."

"And we spend a lifetime undoing the damage caused by cruelty, neglect, and all manner of lovelessness experienced in our families of origin and in relationships where we simply did not know what to do."

## chap1
-- on the importance of having a clear working definition

Quote from Diane Ackerman:
"Without a supple vocabulary, we can't even talk or think about it directly."

"Our confusion about what we mean when we use the word "love" is the source of our difficulty in loving.
If our society had a commonly held understanding of the meaning of love, the act of loving would not be so mystifying.
Dictionary definitions of love tend to emphasize romantic love [...]
However, deep affection does not really adequately describe love's meaning."
--vgl also bell hooks's text about the importance of theory for the praxis

".. all the more astute theorists of love acknowledge that we would all love better if we used it as a verb"

"Erich Fromm, he defines love as "the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth."
Explaining further, he continues: "Love is as love does. Love is an act of will — namely, both an intention and an action.
Will also implies choice. We do not have to love. We choose to love.""
-- vgl also Amy March

DEF:
"Affection is only one ingredient of love.
To truly love we must learn to mix various ingredients — care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, and trust, as well as honest and open commmunication.
Learning faulty definitions of love when we are quite young makes it difficult to be loving as we grow older."
-- vgl also the description of limerence ("being in love") and how contrasting its definition and actions seem to be from loving

or short version:
"genuine love ( a combination of care, commitment, trust, knowledge, responsibility, and respect)"

"When we understand love as the will to nurture our own and another's spiritual growth, it becomes clear that we cannot claim to love if we are hurtful and abusive.
Love and abuse cannot coexist.
Abuse and neglect are, by definition, the opposites of nurturance and care."

Am Rande, glaub, es tut nicht sehr viel zur Sache.
"An overwhelming majority of us come from dysfunctional families in which we were taught we were not okay, where we were shamed, verbally and/or physically abused, and emotionally neglected evenas were also taught to believe that we were loved.
For most folks it is just too threatening to embrace a definition of love that would no longer enable us to see love as present in our families."

"Most psychologically and/or physically abused children have been taught by parenting adults that love can coexist with abuse. [...]
So that just as we would cling to the notion that those who hurt us as children loved us, we try to rationalize being hurt by other adults by insisting that they love us."
"A lack of sustained love does not mean the absence of care, affection, or pleasure."

"One pattern that made the practice of love especially difficult was my constantly choosing to be with men who were emotionally wounded, who were not that interested in being loving even though they desired to be loved."
"I got what I was accustomed to getting — care and affection, usually mingled with a degree of unkindness, neglect, and, on some occasions, outright cruelty."

"many of us are more comfortable with the notion that love can mean anything to anybody precisely because when we define it with precision and clarity it brings us face to face with our lacks [..]
The truth is, far too many people in our culture do not know what love is."

"It is particularly distressing that so many recent books on love continue to insist that definitions of love are unnecessary and meaningless.
Or worse, the authors suggest love should mean something different to men than it does to women."
"This type of literature is popular because it does not demand a change in fixed ways of thinking about gender roles, culture, or love."

"To begin by always thinking of love as an action rather than a feeling is one way in which anyone using the word in this manner automatically assumes accountability and responsibility.
We are often taught we have no control over our "feelings".
Yet most of us accept that we choose our action, that intention and will inform what we do.
We also accept that our actions have consequences."


## chap3

"A commonly accepted assumption in a patriarchal culture is that love can be present in a situation where one group or individual dominates another."

"All visionary male thinkers challenging male domination insist that men can return to love only by repudiating the will to dominate."

Quoting Stoltenberg (whoever that is):
"Learning to live as a man of conscience means deciding that your loyalty to the people whom you loe is always more important than whatever lingering loyalty you may sometimes feel to other men's judgement on your manhood."

"Heterosexual women are often schooled by other women in the art of lying to men as a way to manipulate"
-- I guess this is one social repercussion of the understanding what love is on women

"We are encouraged to see hones people as naive, as potential losers."

"Lovelessness is a boon to consumerism."

"Creating a false self to mask fears and insecurities has become so common that many of us forget who we are and what we feel underneath the pretense."

"When we hear another person's thoughts, beliefs, and feelings, it is more difficult to project on to them our perception of who they are."
-- vgl limerence

## chap4

Quote M. Scott Peck
"Commitment is inherent in any genuinely loving relationship.
Anyone who is truly concerned for the spiritual growth of another knows, consciously or instinctively, that he or she can significantly foster that growth only through a relationship of constancy."

"Sexist socialization teaches females that self-assertiveness is a threat to femininity.
Accepting this faulty logic lays the groundwork for low self-esteem."

"Often, workers believe that if their home life is good, it does not matter if they feel dehumanized and exploited on the job."
-- you and me against the world baby -> uns die structurelle seelenlosigkeit in die schuhe schieben und wir müssen privat dafür aufkommen

"Many jobs undermine self-love because they require that workers constantly prove their worth.
Individuals who are dissatisfied and miserable on the job bring this negative energy home.
Clearly, much of the violence in domestic life, both physical and verbal abuse, is linked to job misery."


## chap 7

"Instead of looking for justice in the public world, individuals turned to their private lives, seeking a place of solace and escape.
Initially, lots of folks turned inward to family and relationships to find again a sense of connection and stability."
-- you and me against the world baby -> ist nur leider nicht nachhaltig, weil es die underlying politische probleme nicht löst

"Geniune love is rarely an emotional space where needs are instantly gratified.
To know genuine love we have to invest time and commitment.
As John Welwood reminds us in Journey of the Heart: The Path of Conscious Love, "dreamingthat love will save us, solve all our problems or provide a steady state of bliss or security only keeps us stuck in wishful fantasy, underminint hte real power of the love — which is to transform us."
Many people want love to funtion like a drug, giving them an immediate and sustained high.
They want to do nothing, just passively receive the good feeling.
In patriarchal culture men are especially inclined to see love as something they should receive without expending effort."

"When greedy consumption is the order of the day, dehumanization becomes acceptable.
Then, treating people like objects is not only acceptable but is required behavior."


## chap8

"Communities sustain life — not nuclear families, or the "couple", and certainly not the rugged individualist."

"Peck defines community as the coming together of a group of  individuals "who have learned how to communicate honestly with each other, whose relationships go deeper than their masks of composure, and who have developed some significant commintment to 'rejoice together, mourn together,' and to 'delight in each other, and make other's conditions our own.'"

"Replacing the family community with a more privatized small autocratic unit helped increase alienation and made abuses of power more possible."
"By encouraging the segregation of nuclear families from the extended family, women were forced to become more dependent on an individual man"
"[extended families].. are diverse and so are likely to include the presence of some individuals who are both sane and loving "


"Since we choose our friends, many of us, from childhood on into our adulthood, have looked to friends for the care, respect, knowledge and all-around nurturance of our growth that we did not find in the family."

"friendship is the place in which a great majority of us have our first glimpse of redemptive love and caring community"

"Often we take freindships for granted even when they are the interactions where we experience mutual pleasure.
We place them in a secondary position, especially in relation to romantic bonds.
This devaluation of our friendships creates an emptiness we may not see when we are devoting all our attention to finding someone to love romantically or giving all our attention to achosed loved one."

"I have felt especailly devastated when close friends who were signle fell in love and simultaneously fell away from our friendship."

"Trust is the hearbeat of genuine love."

"There is no special love exclusively reserved for romantic partners
Genuine love is the foundation of our engagement with ourselves, with family, with friends, with partners, with everyone we choose to love.
While we will necessarily behave differently depending on the nature of a relationship, or have varying degrees of commitment, the values that inform our behavior, when rooted in a love thic, are always the same for any interaction."

"I found myself accepting behavior (verbal and physical abuse) that I would not have tolerated in a friendship."
"I have been reaised conventionally to believe this relationship was "special" and should be revered above all.
Most women and men born in the fifties or earlier were socialized to believe that marriages and/or committed romantic bounds of any kind should take precendence over all other relationships.
Had I been evaluating my relationship from a standpoint that emphasized growth rather than duty and obligation, I would have understood that abuse irreparably undermines bonds. "

"In actuality, when we love rightly we know that the healthy, loving response to cruelty and abuse is putting ourselves out of harm's way."

"I would've been able to leave this relationship sooner or recover myself withn it had I brought to this bond the level of respect, care, knowledge , and responsibility I brought to friendships."

"Satisfying friendships in which we share mutual love provides a guide for behavior in other relationships, including romantic ones."

"Knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving.
When we can be alone, we can be with others without using them as a means of escape."


# chap9

"The widespread success of books like THe Rules: Time-tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr. RIght, which encourage women to deceive and manipulate to get a partner, express the cynicism of our times.
These books validate the old-fashioned sexist notions of sexual difference and encourage women to believe that no relationship between a man and a woman can be based on mutual respect, openness, and caring,
The message they give women is that relationships are always and only about power, manipulation, and coercion, about getting someone else to do what you want them to, even if it is against their will"
-- vlt kann man im Comic so was lesen und sich darüber lustig machen?

"In these books male inability and/or refusal to honestly express feelings is often talked about as a positive masculine virtue women should learn to accept rather than a leanred habit of behavior that creates emotional isolation and alienation."

"Self-help books that are anti-gender equality often present women's overinvestment in nurturance as a "natural", inherent quality rather than a learned approach to caregiving."

"More often than not females are taught in childhood, either by parental caregivers or the mass media, how to give the basic care that ir part of the practice of love.
We are shown how to be empathic, how to nurture, and, most important, how to listen."

"Choosing to be honest is the first step in the process of love."

"the first responsibility of love if to listen"

"Sometimes women hear repeatedly that their partners are "sick of listening to this shit.""
"Usually, partners who are unable to respond compassionately when hearing us speak our pain, whether they understand it or not, are unable to listen because that expressed hurt triggers their own feelings of powerlessness and helplessness."

"Discipline and devotion are necessary to the practice of love, all the more so when relationships are just beginning."
-- relationships are hard work
"Anyone who is truly concerned for the spiritual growth of another knows, consciously or instinctively, that he or she can significantly foster that growth only through a relationship of constancy."

"many people fear getting trapped in a bond that is not working, so they flee at the onset of conflict"

!!"Gettiing your emotional needs met helps create greater psychological well-being.
As a consequence, men are given an advantage that hneatly coincides with the patriarchal insistence that they are superior and therefore better suited to rule others.
Were women's emotional needs met, were mutuality the norm, male domination might lose its allure."

"put your partenr's interes on an equal footing with your own"

# Laurie Penny - Chapter Love and Lies

"And yet somehow, so little has changed.
Because despite their money, their privilege, their friendships, the great sex they seemed to be having, the jobs they apparently had, although they rarely seemed to actually do them, the weird spoilt child-women of Sex and the City were still miserable, still looking for something — if they hadn't been, there would have been no story.
What they were looking for was what every woman and girl is still, always, supposed to be looking for: love.
For monogamous, marriage-minded romantic partnership with the man of their dreams.
Every girl's story was a love story."
(-vgl Little Women: "And if the main character is a girl, make sure she is married by the end")

"It demonstrated that even the most powerful, liberated women the world had ever known could still bebrought low by love, could still be ruined by disappointment in the quest for love."

"The colonisation of love by capitalist patriarchy is a deeply painful thing.
It means that structural sexism and cultural violence are played out on small, private stages, which is what makes them so very hard to recognise and resist.
    Human love is radical, and it is devastating.
And human love has been thoroughly captured by neoliberalism, by the mindset and mechanisms of profit."

"Love is a gendered thing.
It also makes life worth living and politics worth doing.
Everyone seems to agree that love is important — but what sort of love?"
"Part of the problem is our lack of language to describe love, and that problem is political.
Semantic context collapse means that we only have one word, 'love', for the vast spectrum of passion and compassion, compresion and care that make our species worth saving.
The English language has hundreds of thousands of words,[..], but only one to describe the very thing we're told is most important."
-> Idea: Struggling with this; Spoken-word performance of bell hooks (and her definition of love)


"And of every possible definition of love, it is romantic love between couples, monogamous sexual and social commitment between two people that is considered the most important."
-> Vgl Outlander: Claire gets back in time to be with Jamie
(and at some point has a melt-down realising that she left her whole life, friends and work she loves behind. Which then miraculously disappears, never to be questioned again.)
"This is no accident.
    Love and fucking are the field on which gender gets personal.
Where stereotypes are cast in craving and formed in bitterness on every side."

"The more I talk to people about love and work and gender and sex and power, the more it comes down to[..] the stories we tell ourselves and how they map on to our experience of real human beings trying to fit our messy, meaty hearts into the anatomically inaccurate totem of romance."
-> Vgl: Stories spoilt me for romantic love (and also for any love bc I am aspiring to the unreachable ideal of the romantic love) because they created unrealistic expectations of it is supposed to look like.
And the thing about stories is, they are not real.
"the thing about stories is that somebody made them up"

-> Also, I don't have time for a relationship
"I was no longer That Girl.
I didn't have time to save boys any more.
I had other priorites, and those priorities included writing.
You cannot be a writer and have writing be anything other than the central romance of your life"

"And yet love, romantic love, is the one thing we're not supposed to queston.
Why not?"

"When we talk about love conquering all, when we speak, in that glazed, cultish way, of love's healing power.. we are not talking about love in its broadest sense.
We are not referring to the actual practice of caring for a person and being cherished in return, or of giving of oneself for another, whether that be a friend, a family member, a lover or a stranger."
"The notion of romance that we are all encouraged to go searching for is something different.
It is something smaller and more specific.
It is love as ritual and as product, [..] love whose highest ideal is still hererosexual, monogamous romance leading eventually to lasting marriage."
-> "as ritual": vgl Teenies/Pretenies and Crushes: it is a ritual; something to participate in ("ich hab fast das gefühl, ein teil davon war, nur um da mitzumachen und sich mit iwas zu beschäftigen")
This sort of love is valued above every other, even though it is now a minority practice, and even though the many millions who are living happily in such partnerships find the reality far more complex than is considered proper to discuss."
-> no one acknowledges it is actually hard work to maintain a working relationship; a lot of communication, time, energy;

"Both stories, LoveTM and SexTm, hold us up to impossible standards.
Both demand that we see another person as less than human, merely a body filling a prewritten role in our script or romantic or erotic extasy.
Both are wildly unrealistic, and both set us up to fail."
-> Beweis for love is work; for stories spoilt me for relationships; also vgl limerence

"Back in the real world, most people's lives exist on a spectrum somewhere between One True Love and meaningless rutting.
Even those of us taken in by the fantasy know this to be the case, and yet it's frowned upon to speak of that spectrum in positive terms.
We are required instead to acknowledge that any person or pair of persons failing to achieve LoveTM or SexTm are doomed to live terribly sad lives"

"LoveTM has become devotional, especially for women.
We search for it, profess belief in it, make sacrifices for it."

"The quest for Great Love is the ultimate devotion, the ultimate sign of being a good woman who can command the interest of men."
"LoveTM demands demonstrations of faith in the face of logic.
'The perfect person is out there,' we say to our friends who are single and sad, as if merely repeating the mantra might make it so."

"Religion, like opium, was a refuge from the anxieties of the age, replacing personal, individual dispair with a whole new set of problems.
Right now, romantic love as we know it functions in much the same way."
"We don't just fall for all of this romantic faff because we're stupid, or guillable, or weak.
We fall because we want to, because we need to believe that something will make the rest of our lives safe and meaningful.
The postures of romance, particularly straight, married romance, allow us to reject the grim meat-hook reality of work and death even as they fashion us for it, pairing us off into little pockets of pain and passion: you and me against the world, baby."
->vlt include cupcake poem??
"To Laurie Penny
Romantic love, we're told, is something rare and precious,
shared love is like the sweet sweet icing of a double-chocolate cupcake:
two hearts and two souls melt into one sticky sugary substance in a paper muffin form.
Each one in its own separate private nest on the muffin pan conform
with what they told us love was like: "The two of us against the world",
                                                and if by some mistake
the dough spills over and more cupcakes on the pan connect
the baker throws them in the trash without a second thought or due respect."

"You can use it [human passion] to isolate people in antagonistic pairs and let them blame each other for the structural lack of sweetness in the world."

"Women across the classes are taught to seek the love of men first, to assess our worth on the basis of how good we are at keeping and holding male attention.
And across the classes, romantic humiliation can be used to bring women low."
(vgl vlt Ch's "Früher dacht ich, es wäre ein Kompliment, wenn mir jemand nen Klaps auf den Hintern verpasst.")

"But men, too, have equal power of refusal in relationships.
They can refuse to give of themselves in a way that is equally humiliating to women who have grown up learning that they were failing on a basic level if they could not command the love and commitment of men.
And that's it. That's how heterosexuality makes us all miserable."

The story about "but I only kiss very beautiful girls"
"He's drunk. He doesn't mean to be that much of a prick.
But we both know what he means, and it hurts because he's right: I'm not the sort of girl who gets kissed by boys like that.
I'm not a sexy little package. I'm scrappy and opinionated....."
"And for a moment that sins out reeling in the hurt, private parts of the heart, I wish I was a different kind of girl.
A girl like the girl I see the same boy rolling under a blanket with in the communal bedding area two hours later, soft-spoken with long, pretty hair.
I am eaten up by jealousy, and that's how they get you.
It's the night before a big march, but I abandon sleep.
Instead, I get the laptop out and take it to a place where people are too stoned and sleepy to take notice of my pathetic little tears.
This is stupid. There's work to be done.
Tomorrow tens of thousands of us are going to take to the streets to demand fair access to education, and my smashed little heart shouldn't matter. But it odes.
The whole world is changing, and I just want to be the kind of girl who gets taken in somebody's arms.
[...]
I think about maybe growing my hair out and wearing more skirts.
And that's how they get you.
That's how they keep you in line."

"But deep down, I know if I choose not to play the good girl game, I might not get as many kisses as I want.
And that's so much more terrifying."
"This, then, is how women are kept in line.
The threat of violence is a fearful thing, but its injustice is clear, and there is always the risk of rebellion. [..]
To tell a person that if they don't do what they're told they will never be loved is an existential threat akin to soul murder.
'If you do not do this, you will be beaten' is ultimately far less effective than 'if you do not do this, nobody will love you.'
It is that fear that keeps us cowed and conformist."
"We don't pare ourselves down and tart ourselves up and process our personality into the mould deemed most pleasing by mainstream culture because we're stupid, or cowardly.
We do it because we fear loss of love.
We do it because we grew up learning, unless our parents were particularly enlightened, that we were unworthy of love unless we conformed to a certain set of rules about how to look, dress and behave."
"If you do follow all the rules, if you ever get it perfectly right, then, of course, you're a dull bimbo, a brainless fembot, just as unworthy of male respect as the ones who didn't."

(comment on Kate Middleton cult)
"As social mobility collapes, princess propaganda is enjoying a shocking pink renaissance, hooking grown women who should know better into the hoary old narrative of One True Love leading inexorably to titular rights to the Duchy of Lancaster.
When we grow up, the princess becomes the shining girl, the good girlfriend.
It may look less likely we'll inherit Cornwall, but we can still be somebody else's beautiful sidekick, which is the best thing a girl can be.
We talk a lot about women as sex objects, but the reduction of women to love objects does just as much damage;[..]
The love object is a thing to be desired and pitied all at once.
She is the helpmeet, the saint, the fantasy.
She is never a complete person.
Whatever attributes make her interesting — maybe she can cook, or sew, or shoot a gun, or solve a crime — she exists ultimately for the hero's edification.
She is nothing without him."
-> Vgl Jo March "I'm sick of .. love is the only thing a woman is fit for."; and manic pixie dream girl; limerence

"Just as many of us, however, spend our lives trying to mould ourselves into love objects.
Almost every female protagonist, in every story written or designed by men, is a love object: a creature fabricated to fulfil a role in somebody else's grand narrative."
-> Vgl Daisy Jones: "I'm not a muse. I'm somebody. End of the fucking story."
"The love object is always a supporting character[...]
She delights, she entices, she is slender and beautiful and whimsical and invariably poorly written, and so many of us spend a great deal of time trying to be her.
Stories shape us, even the shit ones.
Even the ones that are simplistic and obviate a great deal of real-life experience by design.
Stories are how we organise our lives, how we streamline our desires, and sometimes they fall short, and sometimes they disappoint us, and they always matter.
For women, love stories are the stories we are allowed to cast ourselves in, and those are the stories that shape our cravings and identities."
-> They get me every fucking time (except the ones that are really really poorly written. Maybe I should move to Inverness as well^^)

"LoveTM is meant to be the overwhelming object of a woman's early life; her story ends when she finds it, or fails to find it.
The most important thing is that her story ends."
"young men [...] have so many other stories to work with"
"Little girls, though, only ever get two choices: we can be the princess, or we can be the witch." //Actually, I think we could also be the fairy godmother (which is probably also the only positive narrative for an elderly woman who is not married)

"This is why female artists and women writers remain figures of suspicion.
Men are allowed to make their work, their practice, the central romance of their lives.
Men are allowed to love their art, their writing, their passion, a little bit more than anything else.
Women are not, and if we choose to do so anyway, we will always be seen as lacking something, or taking on a man's role, or both.
Whatever else we do with our lives, we must carve out part of our hearts in the service of others, or we are not really women.
We are permitted to be the wives and lovers of great men, but if we try to become great ourselves [..] there must be something wrong with us."

"I was a manic pixie dream girl"
-> yeah, me too

"Women behave in was that they find sanctioned in stories written by men who know better, and men and women seek out friends and partners who remind them of a girl they met in a book one day when they were young and longing."
"For me, Manic Pixie Dream Gril was the story that fit."
Following description on why -> adapt this
"I had the raw materials: I'm five feet nothing, petite and small-featured with skin the colour of something left on the bottom of a pond for too long and messy hair that's sometimes dyed a shocking shade of red or pink.
At least, it was before I washed all the dye out last year, partly to stop soulful Zach-Braff-a-likes following me to the shops.
And, yes, I'm a bit strange and sensitive and daydreamy, and, yes, I retain a somwhat embarassing belief in the ultimate decency of humanity and the transformative brilliance of music, lathough I'm ambivalent on the Shins.
I love to dance, I play the guitar badly, and I also — since we are in confession mode, dear reader, hear and forgive — I also play the fucking ukulele. Truly."
-> For the adaptation: I also have messy hair, which I hated when growing up bc it essentially allowed one hairstyle: this what my mother called " an unraveled basket" or "kicked around cabbage"; and in which at some point I started to take some weird pride, bc it was easier that way since it required zero action and it was something people seemed to like (which I was always kind of suspicious towards);
tried dying my hair pink, but never went the whole way of actually bleaching it first, partially out of fear that it'll fall out and partially out of plain old lazyness.
I did cut half of it once, due do a drunken bet though.
I play the guitar, or rather, used to, initially forced into it by my parents since "we have no space to put in a piano, but here's you father's old guitar" and rather lacklusterly; (which may have partially been due to the teachers who came from classical music and never seemed to have anything interesting to play) later; I took a liking to it, partially bc it seemed cool and you know "this is what girls fall for" (or maybe the boys?)
I walked around in middle school, the time when girls fought wars over Britney Spears vs Christina Agilera and Spice Girls vs Backstreet Boys, telling everyone that my favourite band was Queen, of which I've heard a grand total of 2 albums (or 3?), one of which was "Greatest Hits" (to be fair, I rather liked Queen and still do, so it was not a pose per se.)
I like to dance and sing, which I both do in a reasonably mediocre fashion, but it's fun.
In highschool, I went throught the obligatory phase of picking up street signs and cones and other random stuff of the streets and giving people cobble stones for their birthdays.
And of course, through the phase of doodling on your sneakers and drawing stuff on your own shirts (I even painted my prom dress).
And I also, "doubtless honed by that learned girlish desire to please", have always gone out of my way to include new people in groups.

"But the Manic Pixie is never a point-of-view character, and she isn't understood from the inside.
She's one of those female tropes who is permitted precisely no interiority.
Instead of a personality, she has eccentricities, a vaguely offbeat favourite band, a funky fringe."
"Most of the classic Manic Pixie Dream Girls claim to be ironic re-imaginings of a character trope that they fail to actually interrogate in any way.
Irony is, of course, the last vestige of modern crypto-misogyny: all those lazy stereotypes and hurtful put-downs are definitely a joke, right up until they aren't, and clearly youneed a man to tell you when and if you're supposed to take sexism seriously."
"Men write women, and they rewrite us, for revenge.
It's about obsession, and control."
"[...] Kazan told the Huffington Post.
'Everybody is setting out to write a full character.
It's just that some people are limited in their imagination of a girl. '


"She doesn't get a story. She is part of a story that happens to other people."
"Men grow up expecting to be the hero of their own story.
Women grow up expecting to be the supporting actress in somebody else's."
-> Vgl Daisy Jones. (Und Margarete Stokowski)

"If we want anything interesting at all to happen to us we have to be a story that happens to somebody else"

"Lady hobbits didn't bring the ring to Mordor. They stayed at home in the Shire."

"I was prepared for the personal to be political.
What I didn't understand until quite recently was that the political can be so, so personal."

"a choice to stop being That Girl and start becoming a grown woman, which is the worst possible thing a girl can do, which is why so many of those Manic Pixie Dream Girl characters, as written by male geeks and scriptwriters, either die tragically young or are somehow immortally fixed at the physical and mental age of nineteen and a half.
Meanwhile, in th real world, the very worst thing about being a real-life MPDG is the look of disappointment on the face of someone you really care about when they find out you're not their fantasy at all — you're a real human who breaks wind and has a job."

"And it's a struggle.
Because I reamin a small, friendly, excitable person who wears withy colours and has a tendency towards the twee."

"So, here's what I've learned, in twenty-seven years of reading books and kissing boys.
Firstly, avaregely pretty white women in their late teens and twenties are not the biggest, most profoundly unsolvable mystery in the universe. [...]
Those of us with an ounce of lust for life are almost universally less interesting than we will be in our thirties and forties."
"The one abiding secret about us is that we're not fantasies, and we weren't made to save you: we are real people, with flaws and cracked personalities and big dreams and digetive tracts."

"Because it turns out that LoveTM is also the theoretical basis for most of the work done for free, largely by women, so that the mechanisms of profit and production can be maintained.
Most of the work of childcare, cooking, cleaning, personal care, helpmeeting and mopping up your husband's ego after a hard day's wage labour is not recognised as 'real work' because it is done out of 'love'"
"a lot of work that women do remains unpaid or underpaid because we think of it as 'love', as a moral expression of feelng rather than a practical task of immense and tangible value"

"For men, LoveTm is more likely to mean continuing in one's occupation of choice with the support of a partner who cherishes and believes in you, will take care of you when work exhausts you, will handle all the arrangements for the care and upbringing of your children so you don't have to hink about it, and will provide you with your preferredform of sexual release at the end of the working day."

".. and even a minority who work as primary carers for children, but that minority is still small — and enormously culturally underrepresented to the extent that such arrangements still fail to register in the life plans of most young men."
-- die dann auch krass gefeiert werden, dass sie ein bisschen Zeit mit ihren Kindern verbracht haben

"For men, love is supposed to be the reward you get in return for work; for women, love is work in itself."

"Marriage used to be understood as an essentially economic arrangement."-> vgl Amy March

On marriage:
"'the net effect of the neoliberal economic policies imposed in recent decades has been to push economic and social responsibility away from eployers and government and onto private households.[...] In more and more cases, the sole remaining resoure is the cooperative, mutually supporting household or kinship netowrk. 
But if marriage is the symbolic and legal anchor or households and kinship networks, and marriage is increasingly unstable, how relable will that source of support be?'" (quoting Richard Kim and Lisa Duggan from "Beyound Gay Marriage")

"Women learn to fear being 'left on the shelf', to associate it with poverty and isolation."

"We are all encouraged to feel sorry for ourselves if we are single, to consider ourselves incomplete, but women in particular are urged to consider themselves inferior if their time in not spent comforting and cosseting a man, and ideally, children too."

"Your job is now your boyfriend: neither of them can be trusted to stick around, so you'd better make sure they know how much you love them."

"It's not that I don't believe in romantic love, in LoveTM.
It patently exists. People shape their lives to stories, and sometimes it works." 
-- and sometimes it doesn't^^, leaving you feeling inferior
"LoveTM is not true love, in the sense that many other kinds of love are also true."

"But the relatively recent cultural narrative of The One — the idea that everyone has a soulamte whom they are destined to love for ever, and that your life will always be incomplete if you fail to meet, mate and move in with that person — that's not just implausible, it's cruel."
-- vgl "If there's only one person for you in the whole world and you lose them, does that mean that you have to live the rest of your life without anyone else? I think you, we, anyone, has to be open to possibilities"

"The people for whom LoveTm works [...] are in the minority.
Now that we are not obliged to choose between celibate loneliness and yoking ourselves for ever to a person we may grow to despise, most people's lives contain many important relationships, and sometimes those relationships fade or fizzle out.
That may not fit in with the dominant ideology — that monogamous marriage is the only possible healthy way to live,love and distribute welfare benefits — but it's a more accurate map of the human heart"

"No wonder increasing numbers of young people are exploring options — polyamory, open relationships, extended circles of chosen family and fuckbuddies"

"Fre love is love that is not co-opted or coerced, lovethat is not mutually oppressive, love that is not another word for work, duty and conformity."

"The idea that we have no control over who we love and what we do about it is one of the most disempowering things girls are ever told.
Loneliness is a fearful thing.
But a life lived grasping for another person to make you whole is just as fearful.
If you see yourself as incomplete without a partner to be your 'other half', you will always be lonely, even in a partnership."

# Fazit

"If we want to escape the straitjacket of gender under neoliberalism, we must stop trying so hard to hold ourselves and others up to impossible standards, standards we didn't set ourselves.
We have to resist the schooled inner voice teling us to be good girls, tough boys, perfect women, strong men.
If we are to realise a greater collective humanity, we must learn to see one another as human beings first."

"We must refuse to judge others by any standard other than that of kindness and decency.
We must not start out by apologising for all that we are.
It's about saying no and expecting that no to be respected."

"Because when we are done hating oursleves and hurting each other, wecanget on with asking for what should be ours by right."
"Neoliberal patriarchy gives us choice, but not freedom."
"Feminism and radical politics are about demanding more than a choice between one type of servitude and another."
