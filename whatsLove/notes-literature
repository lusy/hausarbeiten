# Laurie Penny - Chapter Love and Lies

"And yet somehow, so little has changed.
Because despite their money, their privilege, their friendships, the great sex they seemed to be having, the jobs they apparently had, although they rarely seemed to actually do them, the weird spoilt child-women of Sex and the City were still miserable, still looking for something — if they hadn't been, there would have been no story.
What they were looking for was what every womand and girl is still, always, supposed to be looking for: love.
For monogamous, marriage-minded romantic partnership with the man of their dreams.
Every girl's story was a love story."
(-vgl Little Women: "And if the main character is a girl, make sure she is married by the end")

"It demonstrated that even the most powerful, liberated women the world had ever known could still bebrought low by love, could still be ruined by disappointment in the quest for love."

"The colonisation of love by capitalist patriarchy is a deeply painful thing.
It means that structural sexism and cultural violence are played out on small, private stages, which is what makes them so very hard to recognise and resist.
    Human love is radica, and it is devastating.
And human love has been thoroughly captured by neoliberalism, by the mindset and mechanisms of profit."

"Love is a gendered thing.
It also makes life worth living and politics worth doing.
Everyone seems to agree that love is important — but what sort of love?"
"Part of the problem is our lack of language to describe love, and that problem is political.
Semantic context collapse means that we only have one word, 'love', for the vast spectrum of passion and compassion, compresion and care that make our species worth saving.
The English language has hundreds of thousands of words,[..], but only one to describe the very thing we're told is most important."
-> Idea: Struggling with this; Spoken-word performance of bell hooks (and her definition of love)


"And of every possible definition of love, it is romantic love between couples, monogamous sexual and social commitment between two people that is considered the most important."
-> Vgl Outlander: Claire gets back in time to be with Jamie
"This is no accident.
    Love and fucking are the field onwhich gender gets personal.
Where stereotypes are cast in craving and formed in bitterness on every side."

"The more I talk to people about love and work and gender and sex and power, the more it comes down to[..] the stories we tell ourselves and how they map on to our experience of real human beings trying to fit our messy, meaty hearts into the anatomically inaccurate totem of romance."
-> Vgl: Stories spoilt me for romantic love (and also for any love bc I am aspiring to the unreachable ideal of the romantic love) because they created unrealistic expectations of it is supposed to look like.
And the thing about stories is, they are not real.
"the thing about stories is that somebody made them up"

"And yet love, romantic love, is the one thing we're not supposed to queston.
Why not?"

"When we talk about love conquering all, when we speak, in that glazed, cultish way, of love's healing power.. we are not talking about love in its broadest sense.
We are not referring to the actual practice of caring for a person and being cherished in return, or of giving of oneself for another, whether that be a friend, a family member, a lover or a stranger."
"The notion of romance that we are all encouraged to go searching for is something different.
It is something smaller and more specific.
It is love as ritual and as product, [..] love whose highest ideal is still hererosexual, monogamous romance leading eventually to lasting marriage."
-> "as ritual": vgl Teenies/Pretenies and Crushes: it is a ritual; something to participate in ("ich hab fast das gefühl, ein teil davon war, nur um da mitzumachen und sich mit iwas zu beschäftigen")
This sort of love is valued above every other, even though it is now a minority practice, and even though the many millions who are living happily in such partnerships find the reality far more complex than is considered proper to discuss."
-> no one acknowledges it is actually hard work to maintain a working relationship; a lot of communication, time, energy;

"Both stories, LoveTM and SexTm, hold us up to impossible standards.
Both demand that we see another person as less than human, merely a body filling a prewritten role in our script or romantic or erotic extasy.
Both are wildly unrealistic, and both set us up to fail."
-> Beweis for love is work; for stories spoilt me for relationships; also vgl limerence

"Back in the real world, most people's lives exist on a spectrum somewhere between One True Love and meaningless rutting.
Even those of us taken in by the antasy know this to be the case, and yet it's frowned upon to speak of that spectrum in positive terms.
We are required instead to acknowledge that any person or pair of persons failing to achieve LoveTM or SexTm are doomed to live terribly sad lives"

"LoveTM has become devotional, especially for women.
We search for it, profess belief in it, make sacrifices for it."

"The quest for Great Love is the ultimate devotion, the ultimate sign of being a good woman who can command the interest of men."
"LoveTM demands demonstrations of faith in the face of logic.
'The perfect person is out there,' we say to our friends who are single and sad, as if merely repeating the mantra might make it so."

"Religion, like opium, was a refuge from the anxieties of the age, replacing personal, individual dispair with a whole new set of problems.
Right now, romantic love as we know it functions in much the same way."
"We don't just fall for all of this romantic faff because we're stupid, or guillable, or weak.
We fall because we want to, because we need to believe that something will make the rest of our lives safe and meaningful.
The postures of romance, particularly straight, married romance, allow us to reject the grim meat-hook reality of work and death even as they fashion us for it, pairing us off into little pockets of pain and passion: you and me against the world, baby."
->vlt include cupcake poem??
"To Laurie Penny
Romantic love, we're told, is something rare and precious,
shared love is like the sweet sweet icing of a double-chocolate cupcake:
two hearts and two souls melt into one sticky sugary substance in a paper muffin form.
Each one in its own separate private nest on the muffin pan conform
with what they told us love was like: "The two of us against the world",
                                                and if by some mistake
the dough spills over and more cupcakes on the pan connect
the baker throws them in the trash without a second thought or due respect."

"You can use it [human passion] to isolate people in antagonistic pairs and let them blame each other for the structural lack of sweetness in the world."

"Women across the classes are taught to seek the love of men irst, to assess our worth on the basis of how good we are at keeping and holding male attention.
And across the classes, romantic humiliation can be used to bring women low."
(vgl vlt Ch's "Früher dacht ich, es wäre ein Kompliment, wenn mir jemand nen Klaps auf den Hintern verpasst.")

"But men, too, have equal power of refusal in relationships.
They can refuse to give of themselves in a way that is equally humiliating to women who have grown up learning that they were failing on a basic level if they could not command the ove and commitment of men.
And that's it. That's how heterosexuality makes us all miserable."

The story about "but I only kiss very beautiful girls"
"He's drunk. He doesn't mean to be that much of a prick.
But we both know what he means, and it hurts because he's right: I'm not the sort of girl who gets kissed by boys like that.
I'm not a sexy little package. I'm scrappy and opinionated....."
"And for a moment that sins out reeling in the hurt, private parts of the heart, I wish I was a different kind of girl.
A girl like the girl I see the same boy rolling under a blanket with in the communal bedding area two hours later, soft-spoken with long, pretty hair.
I am eaten up by jealousy, and that's how they get you.
It's the night before a big march, but I abandon sleep.
Instead, I get the laptop out and take it to a place where people are too stoned and sleepy to take notice of my pathetic little tears.
This is stupid. There's work to be done.
Tomorrow tens of thousands of us are going to take to the streets to demand fair access to education, and my smashed little heart shouldn't matter. But it odes.
The whole world is changing, and I just want to be the kind of girl who gets taken in somebody's arms.
[...]
I think about maybe growing my hair out and wearing more skirts.
And that's how they get you.
That's how they keep you in line."

"But deep down, I know if I choose not to play th egood girl game, I might not get as many kisses as I want.
And that's so much more terrifying."
"This, then, is how women are kept in line.
The threat of violence is a fearful thing, but its injustice is clear, and there is always the risk of rebellion. [..]
To tell a person that if they don't do what they're told they will never be loved is an existential threat akin to soul murder.
'If you do not do this, you will be beaten' is ultimately far less effective than 'if you do not do this, nobody will love you.'
It is that fear that keeps us cowed and conformist."
"We don't pare ourselves down and tart ourselves up and process our personality into the mould deemed most pleasing by mainstream culture because we're stupid, or cowardly.
We do it because we fear loss of love.
We do it because we grew up learning, unless our parents were particularly enlightened, that we were unworthy of love unless we conformed to a certain set of rules about how to look, dress and behave."
"If you do follow all the rules, if you ever get it perfectly right, then, of course, you're a dull bimbo, a brainless fembot, just as unworthy of male respect as the ones who didn't."

(comment on Kate Middleton cult)
"As social mobility collapes, princess propaganda is enjoying a shocking pink renaissance, hooking grown women who should know better into the hoary old narrative of One True Love leading inexorably to titular rights to the Duchy of Lancaster.
When we grow up, the princess becomes the shining girl, the good girlfriend.
It may look less likely we'll inherit Cornwall, but we can still be somebody else's beautiful sidekick, which is the best thing a girl can be.
We talk a lot about women as sex objects, but the reduction of women to love objects does just as much damage;[..]
The love object is a thing to be desired and pitied all at once.
She is the helpmeet, the saint, the fantasy.
She is never a complete person.
Whatever attributes make her interesting — maybe she can cook, or sew, or shoot a gun, or solve a crime — she exists ultimately for the hero's edification.
She is nothing without him."
-> Vgl Jo March "I'm sick of .. love is the only thing a woman is fit for."; and manic pixie dream girl; limerence

"Just as many of us, however, spend our lives trying to mould ourselves into love objects.
Almost every female protagonist, in every story written or designed by men, is a love object: a creature fabricated to fulfil a role in somebody else's grand narrative."
-> Vgl Daisy Jones: "I'm not a muse. I'm somebody. End of the fucking story."
"The love object is always a supporting character[...]
She delights, she entices, she is slender and beautiful and whimsical and invariably poorly written, and so many of us spend a great deal of time trying to be her.
Stories shape us, even the shit ones.
Even the ones that are simplistic and obviate a great deal of real-life experience by design.
Stories are how we organise our lives, how we streamline our desires, and sometimes they fall short, and sometimes they disappoint us, and they always matter.
For women, love stories are the stories we are allowed to cast ourselves in, and those are the stories that shape our cravings and identities."
-> They get me every fucking time (except the ones that are really really poorly written. Maybe I should move to Inverness as well^^)

"LoveTM is meant to be the overwhelming object of a woman's early life; her tory ends when she finds it, or fails to find it.
The most important thing is that her story ends."
"young men [...] have so many other stories to work with"
"Little girls, though, only ever get two choices: we can be the princess, or we can be the witch." //Actually, I think we could also be the fairy godmother (which is probably also the only positive narrative for an elderly woman who is not married)

"This is why female artists and women writers remain figures of suspicion.
Men are allowed to make their work, their practice, the central romance of their lives.
Men are allowed to love their art, their writing, their passion, a little bit more than anything else.
Women are not, and if we choose to do so anyway, we will always be seen as lacking something, or taking on a man's role, or both.
Whatever else we do with our lives, we must carve out part of our hearts in the service of others, or we are not really women.
We are permitted to be the wives and lovers of great men, but if we try to become great ourselves [..] there must be something wrong with us."


"I was a manic pixie dream girl"
-> yeah, me too

"Women behave in was that they find sanctioned in stories written by men who know better, and men and women seek out friends and partners who remind them of a girl they met in a book one day when they were young and longing."
"For me, Manic Pixie Dream Gril was the story that fit."


"She doesn't get a story. She is part of a story that happens to other people."
"Men grow up expecting to be the hero of their own story.
Women grow up expecting to be the supporting actress in somebody else's."
-> Vgl Daisy Jones. (Und Margarete Stokowski)

"If we want anything interesting at all to happen to us we have to be a story that happens to somebody else"

"Lady hobbits didn't bring the ring to Mordor. They stayed at home in the Shire."
-> Vlt kann man iwie die 20sec Zusammenschnitt of 2 women interacting in the whole LOTR trilogy einbauen.
